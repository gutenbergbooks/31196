<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The following Letters were written to Mr. Thomas Dixon, a working
cork-cutter of Sunderland, during the agitation for Reform in the
spring of the present year. They contain, in the plainest terms I
could use, the substance of what I then desired to say to our English
workmen, which was briefly this:&mdash;"The reform you desire may give you
more influence in Parliament; but your influence there will of course
be useless to you,&mdash;perhaps worse than useless, until you have wisely
made up your minds what you wish Parliament to do for you; and when
you <i>have</i> made up your minds about that, you will find, not only that
you can do it for yourselves, without the intervention of Parliament;
but that eventually nobody <i>but</i> yourselves can do it. And to help
you, as far as one of your old friends may, in so making up your
minds, such and such things are what it seems to me you should ask
for, and, moreover, strive for with your heart and might."</p>

<p>The letters now published relate only to one division of the laws
which I desired to recommend to the consideration of our
operatives,&mdash;those, namely, bearing upon honesty of work, and honesty
of exchange. I hope in the course of next year that I may be able to
complete the second part of the series, [I could not; but 'Fors
Clavigera' is now (1872) answering the same end:] which will relate to
the possible comforts and wholesome laws, of familiar household life,
and the share which a laboring nation may attain in the skill, and the
treasures, of the higher arts.</p>

<p>The letters are republished as they were written, with,
here and there, correction of a phrase, and omission of one
or two passages of merely personal or temporary interest;
the headings only are added, in order to give the reader some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
clue to the general aim of necessarily desultory discussion;
and the portions of Mr. Dixon's letters in reply, referred to
in the text, are added in the Appendix, and will be found
well deserving of attention.</p>

<p class="subhead">THE TWO KINDS OF CO-OPERATION.&mdash;IN ITS HIGHEST SENSE IT
IS NOT YET THOUGHT OF.</p>

<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Denmark Hill</span>, <i>February 4, 1867</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>1. You have now everything I have yet published on political economy;
but there are several points in these books of mine which I intended
to add notes to, and it seems little likely I shall get that soon
done. So I think the best way of making up for the want of these is to
write you a few simple letters, which you can read to other people, or
send to be printed, if you like, in any of your journals where you
think they may be useful.</p>

<p>I especially want you, for one thing, to understand the sense in which
the word "co-operation" is used in my books. You will find I am always
pleading for it; and yet I don't at all mean the co-operation of partnership
(as opposed to the system of wages) which is now so gradually extending
itself among our great firms. I am glad to see it doing so, yet not
altogether glad: for none of you who are engaged in the immediate struggle
between the system of co-operation and the system of mastership know how
much the dispute involves; and none of us know the results to which it
may finally lead. For the alternative is not, in reality, only between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
two modes of conducting business&mdash;it is between two different
states of society. It is not the question whether an amount of wages,
no greater in the end than that at present received by the men, may be
paid to them in a way which shall give them share in the risks and
interest in the prosperity of the business. The question is, really,
whether the profits which are at present taken, as his own right, by
the person whose capital, or energy, or ingenuity, has made him head
of the firm, are not in some proportion to be divided among the
subordinates of it.</p>

<p>2. I do not wish, for the moment, to enter into any inquiry as to the
just claims of capital, or as to the proportions in which profits
ought to be, or are in actually existing firms, divided. I merely take
the one assured and essential condition, that a somewhat larger income
will be in co-operative firms secured to the subordinates, by the
diminution of the income of the chief. And the general tendency of
such a system is to increase the facilities of advancement among the
subordinates; to stimulate their ambition; to enable them to lay by,
if they are provident, more ample and more early provision for
declining years; and to form in the end a vast class of persons wholly
different from the existing operative:&mdash;members of society, possessing
each a moderate competence; able to procure, therefore, not indeed
many of the luxuries, but all the comforts of life; and to devote some
leisure to the attainments of liberal education, and to the other
objects of free life. On the other hand, by the exact sum which is
divided among them, more than their present wages, the fortune of the
man who, under the present system, takes all the profits of the
business, will be diminished; and the acquirement of large private
fortune by regular means, and all the conditions of life belonging to
such fortune, will be rendered impossible in the mercantile community.</p>

<p>3. Now, the magnitude of the social change hereby involved,
and the consequent differences in the moral relations between
individuals, have not as yet been thought of,&mdash;much less
estimated,&mdash;by any of your writers on commercial subjects;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
and it is because I do not yet feel able to grapple with them that I
have left untouched, in the books I send you, the question of
co-operative labor. When I use the word "co-operation," it is not
meant to refer to these new constitutions of firms at all. I use the
word in a far wider sense, as opposed, not to masterhood, but to
<i>competition</i>. I do not mean, for instance, by co-operation, that all
the master bakers in a town are to give a share of their profits to
the men who go out with the bread; but that the masters are not to try
to undersell each other, nor seek each to get the other's business,
but are all to form one society, selling to the public under a common
law of severe penalty for unjust dealing, and at an established price.
I do not mean that all bankers' clerks should be partners in the bank;
but I do mean that all bankers should be members of a great national
body, answerable as a society for all deposits; and that the private
business of speculating with other people's money should take another
name than that of "banking." And, for final instance, I mean by
"co-operation" not only fellowships between trading <i>firms</i>, but
between trading <i>nations</i>; so that it shall no more be thought (as it
is now, with ludicrous and vain selfishness) an advantage for one
nation to undersell another; and take its occupation away from it; but
that the primal and eternal law of vital commerce shall be of all men
understood&mdash;namely, that every nation is fitted by its character,
and the nature of its territories, for some particular employments or
manufactures; and that it is the true interest of every other nation
to encourage it in such speciality, and by no means to interfere with,
but in all ways forward and protect, its efforts, ceasing all
rivalship with it, so soon as it is strong enough to occupy its proper
place. You see, therefore, that the idea of co-operation, in the sense
in which I employ it, has hardly yet entered into the minds of
political inquirers; and I will not pursue it at present; but return
to that system which is beginning to obtain credence and practice
among us. This, however, must be in a following letter.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="LETTER_II" id="LETTER_II"></a>LETTER II.</h2>

<p class="subhead">CO-OPERATION, AS HITHERTO UNDERSTOOD, IS PERHAPS NOT EXPEDIENT.</p>

<p class="date"><i>February 4, 1867.</i></p>

<p>4. Limiting the inquiry, then, for the present, as proposed in the
close of my last letter, to the form of co-operation which is now upon
its trial in practice, I would beg of you to observe that the points
at issue, in the comparison of this system with that of mastership,
are by no means hitherto frankly stated; still less can they as yet be
fairly brought to test. For all mastership is not alike in principle;
there are just and unjust masterships; and while, on the one hand,
there can be no question but that co-operation is better than unjust
and tyrannous mastership, there is very great room for doubt whether
it be better than a just and benignant mastership.</p>

<p>5. At present you&mdash;every one of you&mdash;speak, and act, as if there were
only one alternative; namely, between a system in which profits shall
be divided in due proportion among all; and the present one, in which
the workman is paid the least wages he will take, under the pressure
of competition in the labor-market. But an intermediate method is
conceivable; a method which appears to me more prudent, and in its
ultimate results more just, than the co-operative one. An arrangement
may be supposed, and I have good hope also may one day be effected, by
which every subordinate shall be paid sufficient and regular wages,
according to his rank; by which due provision shall be made out of the
profits of the business for sick and superannuated workers; and by which
the master, <i>being held responsible, as a minor king or governor, for
the conduct as well as the comfort of all those under his rule</i>, shall,
on that condition, be permitted to retain to his own use the surplus profits
of the business which the fact of his being its master may be assumed to
prove that he has organized by superior intellect and energy. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
I think this principle of regular wage-paying, whether it be in the
abstract more just, or not, is at all events the more prudent; for
this reason mainly, that in spite of all the cant which is continually
talked by cruel, foolish, or designing persons about "the duty of
remaining content in the position in which Providence has placed you,"
there is a root of the very deepest and holiest truth in the saying,
which gives to it such power as it still retains, even uttered by
unkind and unwise lips, and received into doubtful and embittered
hearts.</p>

<p>6. If, indeed, no effort be made to discover, in the course of their
early training, for what services the youths of a nation are
individually qualified; nor any care taken to place those who have
unquestionably proved their fitness for certain functions, in the
offices they could best fulfil,&mdash;then, to call the confused wreck
of social order and life brought about by malicious collision and
competition, an arrangement of Providence, is quite one of the most
insolent and wicked ways in which it is possible to take the name of
God in vain. But if, at the proper time, some earnest effort be made
to place youths, according to their capacities, in the occupations for
which they are fitted, I think the system of organization will be
finally found the best, which gives the least encouragement to
thoughts of any great future advance in social life.</p>

<p>7. The healthy sense of progress, which is necessary to the strength
and happiness of men, does not consist in the anxiety of a struggle to
attain higher place, or rank, but in gradually perfecting the manner,
and accomplishing the ends, of the life which we have chosen, or which
circumstances have determined for us. Thus, I think the object of a
workman's ambition should not be to become a master; but to attain
daily more subtle and exemplary skill in his own craft, to save from
his wages enough to enrich and complete his home gradually with more
delicate and substantial comforts; and to lay by such store as shall
be sufficient for the happy maintenance of his old age (rendering him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
independent of the help provided for the sick and indigent by the
arrangement pre-supposed), and sufficient also for the starting of his
children in a rank of life equal to his own. If his wages are not
enough to enable him to do this, they are unjustly low; if they are
once raised to this adequate standard, I do not think that by the
possible increase of his gains under contingencies of trade, or by
divisions of profits with his master, he should be enticed into
feverish hope of an entire change of condition; and as an almost
necessary consequence, pass his days in an anxious discontent with
immediate circumstances, and a comfortless scorn of his daily life,
for which no subsequent success could indemnify him. And I am the more
confident in this belief, because, even supposing a gradual rise in
social rank possible for all well-conducted persons, my experience
does not lead me to think the elevation itself, when attained, would
be conducive to their happiness.</p>

<p>8. The grounds of this opinion I will give you in a future letter; in
the present one, I must pass to a more important point&mdash;namely,
that if this stability of condition be indeed desirable for those in
whom existing circumstances might seem to justify discontent, much
more must it be good and desirable for those who already possess
everything which can be conceived necessary to happiness. It is the
merest insolence of selfishness to preach contentment to a laborer who
gets thirty shillings a week, while we suppose an active and plotting
covetousness to be meritorious in a man who has three thousand a year.
In this, as in all other points of mental discipline, it is the duty
of the upper classes to set an example to the lower; and to recommend
and justify the restraint of the ambition of their inferiors, chiefly
by severe and timely limitation of their own. And, without at present
inquiring into the greater or less convenience of the possible methods
of accomplishing such an object, (every detail in suggestions of this
kind necessarily furnishing separate matter of dispute,) I will merely
state my long-fixed conviction, that one of the most important
conditions of a healthful system
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of social economy, would be the restraint of the properties and
incomes of the upper classes within certain fixed limits. The
temptation to use every energy in the accumulation of wealth being
thus removed, another, and a higher ideal of the duties of advanced
life would be necessarily created in the national mind; by withdrawal
of those who had attained the prescribed limits of wealth from
commercial competition, earlier worldly success, and earlier marriage,
with all its beneficent moral results, would become possible to the
young; while the older men of active intellect, whose sagacity is now
lost or warped in the furtherance of their own meanest interests,
would be induced unselfishly to occupy themselves in the
superintendence of public institutions, or furtherance of public
advantage. And out of this class it would be found natural and prudent
always to choose the members of the legislative body of the Commons;
and to attach to the order also some peculiar honors, in the
possession of which such complacency would be felt as would more than
replace the unworthy satisfaction of being supposed richer than
others, which to many men is the principal charm of their wealth. And
although no law of this purport would ever be imposed on themselves by
the actual upper classes, there is no hindrance to its being gradually
brought into force from beneath, without any violent or impatient
proceedings; and this I will endeavor to show you in my next letter.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_III" id="LETTER_III"></a>LETTER III.</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF TRUE LEGISLATION. THAT EVERY MAN MAY BE A LAW TO HIMSELF.</p>


<p class="date"><i>February 17, 1867.</i></p>

<p>9. No, I have not been much worse in health; but I was asked
by a friend to look over some work in which you will all be
deeply interested one day, so that I could not write again
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
till now. I was the more sorry, because there were several things I
wished to note in your last letter; one especially leads me directly
to what I in any case was desirous of urging upon you. You say, "In
vol. 6th of 'Frederick the Great' I find a great deal that I feel
quite certain, if our Queen or Government could make law, thousands of
our English workmen would hail with a shout of joy and gladness." I do
not remember to what you especially allude, but whatever the rules you
speak of may be, unless there be anything in them contrary to the
rights of present English property, why should you care whether the
Government makes them law or not? Can you not, you thousands of
English workmen, simply make them a law to yourselves, by practising
them?</p>

<p>It is now some five or six years since I first had occasion to speak
to the members of the London Working Men's College on the subject of
Reform, and the substance of what I said to them was this: "You are
all agape, my friends, for this mighty privilege of having your
opinions represented in Parliament. The concession might be
desirable,&mdash;at all events courteous,&mdash;if only it were quite
certain you had got any opinions to represent. But have you? Are you
agreed on any single thing you systematically want? Less work and more
wages, of course; but how much lessening of work do you suppose is
possible? Do you think the time will ever come for everybody to have
<i>no</i> work and <i>all</i> wages? Or have you yet taken the trouble so much
as to think out the nature of the true connection between wages and
work, and to determine, even approximately, the real quantity of the
one, that can, according to the laws of God and nature, be given for
the other; for, rely on it, make what laws you like, that quantity
only can you at last get.</p>

<p>10. "Do you know how many mouths can be fed on an acre of land, or how
fast those mouths multiply? and have you considered what is to be done
finally with unfeedable mouths? 'Send them to be fed elsewhere,' do
you say? Have you, then, formed any opinion as to the time at which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
emigration should begin, or the countries to which it should
preferably take place, or the kind of population which should be left
at home? Have you planned the permanent state which you would wish
England to hold, emigrating over her edges, like a full well,
constantly? How full would you have her be of people, first? and of
what sort of people? Do you want her to be nothing but a large
workshop and forge, so that the name of 'Englishman' shall be
synonymous with 'ironmonger,' all over the world? or would you like to
keep some of your lords and landed gentry still, and a few green
fields and trees?</p>

<p>11. "You know well enough that there is not one of these questions, I
do not say which you can answer, but which you have ever <i>thought</i> of
answering; and yet you want to have voices in Parliament! Your voices
are not worth a rat's squeak, either in Parliament or out of it, till
you have some ideas to utter with them; and when you have the
thoughts, you will not want to utter them, for you will see that your
way to the fulfilling of them does not lie through speech. You think
such matters need debating about? By all means debate about them; but
debate among yourselves, and with such honest helpers of your thoughts
as you can find; if by that way you cannot get at the truth, do you
suppose you could get at it sooner in the House of Commons, where the
only aim of many of the members would be to refute every word uttered
in your favor; and where the settlement of any question whatever
depends merely on the perturbations of the balance of conflicting
interests?"</p>

<p>12. That was, in main particulars, what I then said to the men of the
Working Men's College; and in this recurrent agitation about Reform,
that is what I would steadfastly say again. Do you think it is only
under the lacquered splendors of Westminster,&mdash;you working men
of England,&mdash;that your affairs can be rationally talked over?
You have perfect liberty and power to talk over, and establish for
yourselves, whatever laws you please; so long as you do not interfere
with other people's liberties or properties. Elect a parliament
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of your own. Choose the best men among you, the best at least you can
find, by whatever system of election you think likeliest to secure
such desirable result. Invite trustworthy persons of other classes to
join your council; appoint time and place for its stated sittings, and
let this parliament, chosen after your own hearts, deliberate upon the
possible modes of the regulation of industry, and advisablest schemes
for helpful discipline of life; and so lay before you the best laws
they can devise, which such of you as were wise might submit to, and
teach their children to obey. And if any of the laws thus determined
appear to be inconsistent with the present circumstances or customs of
trade, do not make a noise about them, nor try to enforce them
suddenly on others, nor embroider them on flags, nor call meetings in
parks about them, in spite of railings and police; but keep them in
your thoughts and sight, as objects of patient purpose and future
achievement by peaceful strength.</p>

<p>13. For you need not think that even if you obtained a majority of
representatives in the existing parliament, you could immediately
compel any system of business, broadly contrary to that now
established by custom. If you could pass laws to-morrow, wholly
favorable to yourselves, as you might think, because unfavorable to
your masters, and to the upper classes of society,&mdash;the only result
would be that the riches of the country would at once leave it, and
you would perish in riot and famine. Be assured that no great change
for the better can ever be easily accomplished, or quickly; nor by
impulsive, ill-regulated effort, nor by bad men; nor even by good men,
without much suffering. The suffering must, indeed, come, one way or
another, in all greatly critical periods; the only question, for us,
is whether we will reach our ends (if we ever reach them) through a
chain of involuntary miseries, many of them useless, and all ignoble;
or whether we will know the worst at once, and deal with it by the
wisely sharp methods of Godsped courage.</p>

<p>14. This, I repeat to you, it is wholly in your own power
to do, but it is in your power on one condition only, that of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
steadfast truth to yourselves, and to all men. If there is not, in
the sum of it, honesty enough among you to teach you to frame, and
strengthen you to obey, <i>just</i> laws of trade, there is no hope left
for you. No political constitution can ennoble knaves; no privileges
can assist them; no possessions enrich them. Their gains are occult
curses; comfortless loss their truest blessing; failure and pain
Nature's only mercy to them. Look to it, therefore, first that you get
some wholesome honesty for the foundation of all things. Without the
resolution in your hearts to do good work, so long as your right hands
have motion in them; and to do it whether the issue be that you die or
live, no life worthy the name will ever be possible to you, while, in
once forming the resolution that your work is to be well done, life is
really won, here and for ever. And to make your children capable of
such resolution, is the beginning of all true education, of which I
have more to say in a future letter.</p>

<p class="subhead">THE EXPENSES FOR ART AND FOR WAR.</p>


<p class="date"><i>February 19, 1867.</i></p>

<p>15. In the 'Pall Mall Gazette' of yesterday, second column of second
page, you will find, close to each other, two sentences which bear
closely on matters in hand. The first of these is the statement, that
in the debate on the grant for the Blacas collection, "Mr. Bernal
Osborne got an assenting cheer, when he said that 'whenever science
and art were mentioned it was a sign to look after the national
pockets.'" I want you to notice this fact, <i>i. e.</i>, (the debate in
question being on a <i>total</i> grant of 164,000<i>l.</i>, of which 48,000<i>l.</i>
only were truly for art's sake, and the rest for shop's sake,) in
illustration of a passage in my 'Sesame and Lilies' (pp. 69, 70 of the
small edition, and pp. 46, 47 of Vol. I. of the Revised Series of the
Entire Works),<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#APPENDIX_I" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
to which I shall have again to refer you,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
with some further comments, in the sequel of these letters. The second passage
is to the effect that "The Trades' Union Bill was read a second time,
after a claim from Mr. Hadfield, Mr. Osborne, and Mr. Samuelson, to
admit working men into the commission; to which Mr. Watkin answered
'that the working men's friend was too conspicuous in the body;' and
Mr. Roebuck, 'that when a butcher was tried for murder it was not
necessary to have butchers on the jury.'"</p>

<p>16. Note this second passage with respect to what I said in my last
letter, as to the impossibility of the laws of work being investigated
in the House of Commons. What admixture of elements, think you, would
avail to obtain so much as decent hearing (how should we then speak of
impartial judgment?) of the cause of working men, in an assembly which
permits to one of its principal members this insolent discourtesy of
language, in dealing with a preliminary question of the highest
importance; and permits it as so far expressive of the whole color and
tone of its own thoughts, that the sentence is quoted by one of the
most temperate and accurate of our daily journals, as representing the
total answer of the opposite side in the debate? No! be assured you
can do nothing yet at Westminster. You must have your own parliament,
and if you cannot detect enough honesty among you to constitute a
justly minded one, for the present matters must take their course, and
that will be, yet awhile, to the worse.</p>

<p>17. I meant to have continued this subject, but I see two
other statements in the 'Pall Mall Gazette' of to-day, with
which, and a single remark upon them, I think it will be well
to close my present letter.</p>

<p>(1) "The total sum asked for in the army estimates,
published this morning, is 14,752,200<i>l.</i>, being an increase of
412,000<i>l.</i> over the previous year."</p>

<p>(2) "Yesterday the annual account of the navy receipts
and expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1866, was
issued from the Admiralty. The expenditure was 10,268,115<i>l.</i>
7<i>s.</i>"</p>

<p>Omitting the seven shillings, and even the odd hundred-thousands
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of pounds, the net annual expenditure for army and navy appears to be
twenty-four millions.</p>

<p>The "grant in science and art," two-thirds of which was
not in reality for either, but for amusement and shop interests
in the Paris Exhibition&mdash;the grant which the House of Commons
feels to be indicative of general danger to the national
pockets&mdash;is, as above stated, 164,000<i>l.</i> Now, I believe the
three additional ciphers which turn thousands into millions
produce on the intelligent English mind usually the effect of&mdash;three
ciphers. But calculate the proportion of these two
sums, and then imagine to yourself the beautiful state of
rationality of any private gentleman, who, having regretfully
spent 164<i>l.</i> on pictures for his walls, paid willingly 24,000<i>l.</i>
annually to the policeman who looked after his shutters!
You practical English!&mdash;will you ever unbar the shutters of
your brains, and hang a picture or two in those state-chambers?</p>

<p class="subhead">THE CORRUPTION OF MODERN PLEASURE.&mdash;(COVENT GARDEN
PANTOMIME.)</p>


<p class="date"><i>February 25, 1867.</i></p>

<p>18. There is this great advantage in the writing real letters,
that the direct correspondence is a sufficient reason for
saying, in or out of order, everything that the chances of the
day bring into one's head, in connection with the matter in
hand; and as such things very usually go out of one's head
again, after they get tired of their lodging, they would otherwise
never get said at all. And thus to-day, quite out of
order, but in very close connection with another part of our
subject, I am going to tell you what I was thinking on Friday
evening last, in Covent Garden Theater, as I was looking,
and not laughing, at the pantomime of 'Ali Baba and the
Forty Thieves.'</p>

<p>When you begin seriously to consider the question referred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to in my second letter, of the essential, and in the outcome
inviolable, connection between quantity of wages, and quantity of
work, you will see that "wages" in the full sense don't mean "pay"
merely, but the reward, whatever it may be, of pleasure as well as
profit, and of various other advantages, which a man is meant by
Providence to get during life, for work well done. Even limiting the
idea to "pay," the question is not so much what quantity of coin you
get, as&mdash;what you can get for it when you have it. Whether a
shilling a day be good pay or not, depends wholly on what a
"shilling's worth" is; that is to say, what quantity of the things you
want may be had for a shilling. And that again depends, and a great
deal more than that depends, on what you <i>do</i> want. If only drink, and
foul clothes, such and such pay may be enough for you; if you want
good meat and good clothes, you must have larger wage; if clean rooms
and fresh air, larger still, and so on. You say, perhaps, "every one
wants these better things." So far from that, a wholesome taste for
cleanliness and fresh air is one of the final attainments of humanity.
There are now not many European gentlemen, even in the highest
classes, who have a pure and right love of fresh air. They would put
the filth of tobacco even into the first breeze of a May morning.</p>

<p>19. But there are better things even than these, which one may want.
Grant that one has good food, clothes, lodging, and breathing, is that
all the pay one ought to have for one's work? Wholesome means of
existence and nothing more? Enough, perhaps, you think, if everybody
could get these. It may be so; I will not, at this moment, dispute it;
nevertheless, I will boldly say that you should sometimes want more
than these; and for one of many things more, you should want
occasionally to be amused!</p>

<p>You know, the upper classes, most of them, want to be amused all day
long. They think</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"One moment <i>un</i>amused a misery<br />
Not made for feeble men."<br />
</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Perhaps you have been in the habit of despising them for
this; and thinking how much worthier and nobler it was to
work all day, and care at night only for food and rest, than
to do no useful thing all day, eat unearned food, and spend
the evening, as the morning, in "change of follies and relays
of joy." No, my good friend, that is one of the fatalest deceptions.
It is not a noble thing, in sum and issue of it, not
to care to be amused. It is indeed a far higher <i>moral</i> state,
but is a much lower <i>creature</i> state, than that of the upper
classes.</p>

<p>20. Yonder poor horse, calm slave in daily chains at the railroad
siding, who drags the detached rear of the train to the front again,
and slips aside so deftly as the buffers meet; and, within eighteen
inches of death every ten minutes, fulfils his changeless duty all day
long, content, for eternal reward, with his night's rest, and his
champed mouthful of hay;&mdash;anything more earnestly moral and beautiful
one cannot image&mdash;I never see the creature without a kind of worship.
And yonder musician, who used the greatest power which (in the art he
knew) the Father of spirits ever yet breathed into the clay of this
world;&mdash;who used it, I say, to follow and fit with perfect sound the
words of the 'Zauberfl&ouml;te' and of 'Don Giovanni'&mdash;foolishest and most
monstrous of conceivable human words and subjects of thought&mdash;for the
future "amusement" of his race!&mdash;No such spectacle of unconscious (and
in that unconsciousness all the more fearful) moral degradation of the
highest faculty to the lowest purpose can be found in history. But
Mozart is nevertheless a nobler creature than the horse at the siding;
nor would it be the least nearer the purpose of his Maker that he, and
all his frivolous audiences, should evade the degradation of the
profitless piping, only by living, like horses, in daily physical
labor for daily bread.</p>

<p>21. There are three things to which man is
born<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&mdash;labor,
and sorrow, and joy. Each of these three things has its baseness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and its nobleness. There is base labor, and noble labor.
There is base sorrow, and noble sorrow. There is base
joy, and noble joy. But you must not think to avoid the corruption
of these things by doing without the things themselves.
Nor can any life be right that has not all three.
Labor without joy is base. Labor without sorrow is base.
Sorrow without labor is base. Joy without labor is base.</p>

<p>22. I dare say you think I am a long time in coming to the pantomime;
I am not ready to come to it yet in due course, for we ought to go and
see the Japanese jugglers first, in order to let me fully explain to
you what I mean. But I can't write much more to-day; so I shall merely
tell you what part of the play set me thinking of all this, and leave
you to consider of it yourself, till I can send you another letter.
The pantomime was, as I said, 'Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.' The
forty thieves were girls. The forty thieves had forty companions, who
were girls. The forty thieves and their forty companions were in some
way mixed up with about four hundred and forty fairies, who were
girls. There was an Oxford and Cambridge boat-race, in which the
Oxford and Cambridge men were girls. There was a transformation scene,
with a forest, in which the flowers were girls, and a chandelier, in
which the lamps were girls, and a great rainbow which was all of
girls.</p>

<p>23. Mingled incongruously with these seraphic, and, as far as my
boyish experience extends, novel, elements of pantomime, there were
yet some of its old and fast-expiring elements. There were, in
speciality, two thoroughly good pantomime actors&mdash;Mr. W. H. Payne and
Mr. Frederick Payne. All that these two did, was done admirably. There
were two subordinate actors, who played, subordinately well, the fore
and hind legs of a donkey. And there was a little actress of whom I
have chiefly to speak, who played exquisitely the little part she had
to play. The scene in which she appeared was the only one in the whole
pantomime in which there was any dramatic effort, or, with a few rare
exceptions, any dramatic possibility. It was the home scene, in which
Ali Baba's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
wife, on washing day, is called upon by butcher, baker,
and milkman, with unpaid bills; and in the extremity of her distress
hears her husband's knock at the door, and opens it for him to drive
in his donkey, laden with gold. The children who have been beaten
instead of getting breakfast, presently share in the raptures of their
father and mother; and the little lady I spoke of, eight or nine years
old,&mdash;dances a <i>pas-de-deux</i> with the donkey.</p>

<p>24. She did it beautifully and simply, as a child ought to dance. She
was not an infant prodigy; there was no evidence, in the finish or
strength of her motion, that she had been put to continual torture
through half her eight or nine years. She did nothing more than any
child well taught, but painlessly, might easily do. She caricatured no
older person,&mdash;attempted no curious or fantastic skill. She was
dressed decently,&mdash;she moved decently,&mdash;she looked and behaved
innocently,&mdash;and she danced her joyful dance with perfect grace,
spirit, sweetness, and self-forgetfulness. And through all the vast
theater, full of English fathers and mothers and children, there was
not one hand lifted to give her sign of praise but mine.</p>

<p>Presently after this, came on the forty thieves, who, as I told you,
were girls; and, there being no thieving to be presently done, and
time hanging heavy on their hands, arms, and legs, the forty
thief-girls proceeded to light forty cigars. Whereupon the British
public gave them a round of applause. Whereupon I fell a thinking; and
saw little more of the piece, except as an ugly and disturbing dream.</p>

Mr. Carlyle himself will be pleased to hear this letter when he comes

the light and calm of Italy. I must get back to the evil light and
uncalm, of the places I was taking you through.</p>

<p>(Parenthetically, did you see the article in the 'Times' of yesterday
on bribery, and the conclusion of the commission&mdash;"No one sold any
opinions, for no one had any opinions to sell"?)</p>

<p>Both on Thursday and Friday last I had been tormented by many things,
and wanted to disturb my course of thought any way I could. I have
told you what entertainment I got on Friday, first, for it was then
that I began meditating over these letters; let me tell you now what
entertainment I found on Thursday.</p>

<p>26. You may have heard that a company of Japanese jugglers has come
over to exhibit in London. There has long been an increasing interest in
Japanese art, which has been very harmful to many of our own painters,
and I greatly desired to see what these people were, and what they did.
Well, I have seen Blondin, and various English and French circus work,
but never yet anything that surprised me so much as one of these men's
exercises on a suspended pole. Its special character was a close
approximation to the action and power of the monkey; even to the
prehensile power in the foot; so that I asked a sculptor-friend who
sat in front of me, whether he thought such a grasp could be acquired
by practice, or indicated difference in race. He said he thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
it might be got by practice. There was also much inconceivably
dexterous work in spinning of tops,&mdash;making them pass in balanced
motion along the edge of a sword, and along a level string, and the
like;&mdash;the father performing in the presence of his two children,
who encouraged him continually with short, sharp cries, like those of
animals. Then there was some fairly good sleight-of-hand juggling of
little interest; ending with a dance by the juggler, first as an
animal, and then as a goblin, Now, there was this great difference
between the Japanese masks used in this dance and our common pantomime
masks for beasts and demons,&mdash;that our English masks are only
stupidly and loathsomely ugly, by exaggeration of feature, or of
defect of feature. But the Japanese masks (like the frequent monsters
of Japanese art) were inventively frightful, like fearful dreams; and
whatever power it is that acts on human minds, enabling them to invent
such, appears to me not only to deserve the term "demoniacal," as the
only word expressive of its character; but to be logically capable of
no other definition.</p>

<p>27. The impression, therefore, produced upon me by the whole scene,
was that of being in the presence of human creatures of a partially
inferior race, but not without great human gentleness, domestic
affection, and ingenious intellect; who were, nevertheless, as a
nation, afflicted by an evil spirit, and driven by it to recreate
themselves in achieving, or beholding the achievement, through years
of patience, of a certain correspondence with the nature of the lower
animals.</p>

<p>28. These, then, were the two forms of diversion or recreation of my
mind possible to me, in two days, when I needed such help, in this
metropolis of England. I might, as a rich man, have had better music,
if I had so chosen, though, even so, not rational or helpful; but a
poor man could only have these, or worse than these, if he cared for
any manner of spectacle. (I am not at present, observe, speaking of
pure acting, which is a study, and recreative only as a noble book is;
but of means of <i>mere</i> amusement.)</p>

<p>Now, lastly, in illustration of the effect of these and other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
such "amusements," and of the desire to obtain them, on the minds of our
youth, read the 'Times' correspondent's letter from Paris, in the tenth
page of the paper, to-day;<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#APPENDIX_III" class="fnanchor">[III]</a>
and that will be quite enough for you to read, for the present, I believe.</p>

<p class="subhead">OF THE VARIOUS EXPRESSIONS OF NATIONAL FESTIVITY.</p>


<p class="date"><i>March 4, 1867.</i></p>

<p>29. The subject which I want to bring before you is now branched, and
worse than branched, reticulated, in so many directions, that I hardly
know which shoot of it to trace, or which knot to lay hold of first.</p>

<p>I had intended to return to those Japanese jugglers, after a visit to
a theater in Paris; but I had better, perhaps, at once tell you the
piece of the performance which, in connection with the scene in the
English pantomime, bears most on matters in hand.</p>

<p>It was also a dance by a little girl&mdash;though one older than Ali
Baba's daughter, (I suppose a girl of twelve or fourteen). A dance, so
called, which consisted only in a series of short, sharp contractions
and jerks of the body and limbs, resulting in attitudes of distorted
and quaint ugliness, such as might be produced in a puppet by sharp
twitching of strings at its joints: these movements being made to the
sound of two instruments, which between them accomplished only a quick
vibratory beating and strumming, in nearly the time of a
hearth-cricket's song, but much harsher, and of course louder, and
without any sweetness; only in the monotony and unintended aimless
construction of it, reminding one of various other insect and reptile
cries or warnings: partly of the cicala's hiss; partly of the little
melancholy German frog which says "Mu, mu, mu," all summer-day long,
with its nose out of the pools by Dresden and Leipsic; and partly of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the deadened quivering and intense continuousness of the alarm of the
rattlesnake.</p>

<p>While this was going on, there was a Bible text repeating itself
over and over again in my head, whether I would or no:&mdash;"And
Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her
hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with
dances." To which text and some others, I shall ask your attention
presently; but I must go to Paris first.</p>

<p>30. Not at once, however, to the theater, but to a bookseller's shop,
No. 4, Rue Voltaire, where, in the year 1858, was published the fifth
edition of Balzac's 'Contes Dr&ocirc;latiques,' illustrated by 425
designs by Gustave Dor&eacute;.</p>

<p>Both text and illustrations are as powerful as it is ever in the
nature of evil things to be (there is no <i>final</i> strength but in
rightness). Nothing more witty, nor more inventively horrible, has yet
been produced in the evil literature, or by the evil art, of man: nor
can I conceive it possible to go beyond either in their specialities
of corruption. The text is full of blasphemies, subtle, tremendous,
hideous in shamelessness, some put into the mouths of priests; the
illustrations are, in a word, one continuous revelry in the most
loathsome and monstrous aspects of death and sin, enlarged into
fantastic ghastliness of caricature, as if seen through the distortion
and trembling of the hot smoke of the mouth of hell. Take this
following for a general type of what they seek in death: one of the
most labored designs is of a man cut in two, downwards, by the sweep
of a sword&mdash;one half of him falls toward the spectator; the other
half is elaborately drawn in its section&mdash;giving the profile of
the divided nose and lips; cleft jaw&mdash;breast&mdash;and entrails;
and this is done with farther pollution and horror of intent in the
circumstances, which I do not choose to describe&mdash;still less some
other of the designs which seek for fantastic extreme of sin, as this
for the utmost horror of death. But of all the 425, there is not one,
which does not violate every instinct of decency and law of virtue or
life, written in the human soul.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
31. Now, my friend, among the many "Signs of the Times" the production
of a book like this is a significant one: but it becomes more
significant still when connected with the farther fact, that M.
Gustave Dor&eacute;, the designer of this series of plates, has just
been received with loud acclaim by the British Evangelical Public, as
the fittest and most able person whom they could at present find to
illustrate, to their minds, and recommend with grace of sacred art,
their hitherto unadorned Bible for them.</p>

<p>Of which Bible, and of the use we at present make of it in England,
having a grave word or two to say in my next letter (preparatory to
the examination of that verse which haunted me through the Japanese
juggling, and of some others also), I leave you first this sign of the
public esteem of it to consider at your leisure.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_VIII" id="LETTER_VIII"></a>LETTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="subhead">THE FOUR POSSIBLE THEORIES RESPECTING THE AUTHORITY OF THE BIBLE.</p>


<p class="date"><i>March 7, 1867.</i></p>

<p>32. I have your yesterday's letter, but must not allow myself to be
diverted from the business in hand for this once, for it is the most
important of which I have to write to you.</p>

<p>You must have seen long ago that the essential difference between the
political economy I am trying to teach, and the popular science, is,
that mine is based on <i>presumably attainable honesty</i> in men, and
conceivable respect in them for the interests of others, while the
popular science founds itself wholly on their supposed constant regard
for their own, and on their honesty only so far as thereby likely to
be secured.</p>

<p>It becomes, therefore, for me, and for all who believe anything I say,
a great primal question on what this presumably attainable honesty is
to be based.</p>

<p>33. "Is it to be based on religion?" you may ask. "Are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
we to be honest for fear of losing heaven if we are dishonest, or (to
put it as generously as we may) for fear of displeasing God? Or, are
we to be honest on speculation, because honesty is the best policy;
and to invest in virtue as in an undepreciable stock?"</p>

<p>And my answer is&mdash;not in any hesitating or diffident way (and you
know, my friend, that whatever people may say of me, I often do speak
diffidently; though, when I am diffident of things, I like to avoid
speaking of them, if it may be; but here I say with no shadow of
doubt)&mdash;your honesty is <i>not</i> to be based either on religion or
policy. Both your religion and policy must be based on <i>it</i>. Your
honesty must be based, as the sun is, in vacant heaven; poised, as the
lights in the firmament, which have rule over the day and over the
night. If you ask why you are to be honest&mdash;you are, in the question
itself, dishonored. "Because you are a man," is the only answer; and
therefore I said in a former letter that to make your children
<i>capable of honesty</i> is the beginning of education. Make them men
first, and religious men afterwards, and all will be sound; but a
knave's religion is always the rottenest thing about him.</p>

<p>34. It is not, therefore, because I am endeavoring to lay down a
foundation of religious concrete, on which to build piers of policy,
that you so often find me quoting Bible texts in defense of this or
that principle or assertion. But the fact that such references are an
offense, as I know them to be, to many of the readers of these
political essays, is one among many others, which I would desire you
to reflect upon (whether you are yourself one of the offended or not),
as expressive of the singular position which the mind of the British
public has at present taken with respect to its worshiped Book. The
positions, honestly tenable, before I use any more of its texts, I
must try to define for you.</p>

<p>35. All the theories possible to theological disputants respecting
the Bible are resolvable into four, and four only.</p>

<p>(1.) The first is that of the illiterate modern religious
world, that every word of the book known to them as "The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Bible" was dictated by the Supreme Being, and is in every syllable
of it His "Word."</p>

<p>This theory is of course tenable by no ordinarily well-educated
person.</p>

<p>(2.) The second theory is, that, although admitting verbal error,
the substance of the whole collection of books called the Bible is
absolutely true, and furnished to man by Divine inspiration of the
speakers and writers of it; and that every one who honestly and
prayerfully seeks for such truth in it as is necessary for his
salvation, will infallibly find it there.</p>

<p>This theory is that held by most of our good and upright clergymen,
and the better class of the professedly religious laity.</p>

<p>(3.) The third theory is that the group of books which we call the
Bible were neither written nor collected under any Divine guidance,
securing them from substantial error; and that they contain, like all
other human writings, false statements mixed with true, and erring
thoughts mixed with just thoughts; but that they nevertheless relate,
on the whole, faithfully, the dealings of the one God with the first
races of man, and His dealings with them in aftertime through Christ:
that they record true miracles, and bear true witness to the
resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.</p>

<p>This is a theory held by many of the active leaders of modern thought.</p>

<p>(4.) The fourth, and last possible, theory is that the mass of
religious Scripture contains merely the best efforts which we hitherto
know to have been made by any of the races of men towards the
discovery of some relations with the spiritual world; that they are
only trustworthy as expressions of the enthusiastic visions or beliefs
of earnest men oppressed by the world's darkness, and have no more
authoritative claim on our faith than the religious speculations and
histories of the Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, and Indians; but are, in
common with all these, to be reverently studied, as containing a
portion, divinely appointed, of the best wisdom which human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
intellect, earnestly seeking for help from God, has hitherto been able
to gather between birth and death.</p>

<p>This has been, for the last half-century, the theory of the soundest
scholars and thinkers of Europe.</p>

<p>36. There is yet indeed one farther condition of incredulity
attainable, and sorrowfully attained, by many men of powerful
intellect&mdash;the incredulity, namely, of inspiration in any sense,
or of help given by any Divine power to the thoughts of men. But this
form of infidelity merely indicates a natural incapacity for receiving
certain emotions; though many honest and good men belong to this
insentient class.</p>

<p>37. The educated men, therefore, who may be seriously appealed to, in
these days, on questions of moral responsibility, as modified by
Scripture, are broadly divisible into three classes, severally holding
the last three theories above stated.</p>

<p>Now, whatever power a passage from the statedly authoritative portions
of the Bible may have over the mind of a person holding the fourth
theory, it will have a proportionately greater over that of persons
holding the third or the second. I, therefore, always imagine myself
speaking to the fourth class of theorists. If I can persuade or
influence <i>them</i>, I am logically sure of the others. I say
"logically," for the actual fact, strange as it may seem, is that no
persons are so little likely to submit to a passage of Scripture not
to their fancy, as those who are most positive on the subject of its
general inspiration.</p>

<p>38. Addressing, then, this fourth class of thinkers, I would say to
them, when asking them to enter on any subject of importance to
national morals, or conduct, "This book, which has been the accepted
guide of the moral intelligence of Europe for some fifteen hundred
years, enforces certain simple laws of human conduct which you know
have also been agreed upon, in every main point, by all the religious,
and by all the greatest profane writers, of every age and country.
This book primarily forbids pride, lasciviousness, and covetousness;
and you know that all great thinkers, in every nation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of mankind, have similarly forbidden these mortal vices. This book
enjoins truth, temperance, charity, and equity; and you know that
every great Egyptian, Greek, and Indian, enjoins these also. You know
besides, that through all the mysteries of human fate and history,
this one great law of fate is written on the walls of cities, or in
their dust; written in letters of light, and letters of
blood,&mdash;that where truth, temperance, and equity have been
preserved, all strength, and peace, and joy have been preserved
also;&mdash;that where lying, lasciviousness, and covetousness have
been practised, there has followed an infallible, and, for centuries,
irrecoverable ruin. And you know, lastly, that the observance of this
common law of righteousness, commending itself to all the pure
instincts of men, and fruitful in their temporal good, is by the
religious writers of every nation, and chiefly in this venerated
Scripture of ours, connected with some distinct hope of better life,
and righteousness, to come.</p>

<p>39. "Let it not then offend you if, deducing principles of action
first from the laws and facts of nature, I nevertheless fortify them
also by appliance of the precepts, or suggestive and probable
teachings of this Book, of which the authority is over many around
you, more distinctly than over you, and which, confessing to be
divine, <i>they</i>, at least, can only disobey at their moral peril."</p>

<p>On these grounds, and in this temper, I am in the habit of appealing
to passages of Scripture in my writings on political economy; and in
this temper I will ask you to consider with me some conclusions which
appear to me derivable from that text about Miriam, which haunted me
through the jugglery; and from certain others.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_IX" id="LETTER_IX"></a>LETTER IX.</h2>

<p class="subhead">THE USE OF MUSIC AND DANCING UNDER THE JEWISH THEOCRACY,
COMPARED WITH THEIR USE BY THE MODERN FRENCH.</p>


<p class="date"><i>March 10, 1867.</i></p>

<p>40. Having, I hope, made you now clearly understand with what feeling
I would use the authority of the book which the British public,
professing to consider sacred, have lately adorned for themselves with
the work of the boldest violator of the instincts of human honor and
decency known yet in art-history, I will pursue by the help of that
verse about Miriam, and some others, the subject which occupied my
mind at both theaters, and to which, though in so apparently desultory
manner, I have been nevertheless very earnestly endeavoring to lead
you.</p>

<p>41. The going forth of the women of Israel after Miriam with timbrels
and with dances, was, as you doubtless remember, their expression of
passionate triumph and thankfulness, after the full accomplishment of
their deliverance from the Egyptians. That deliverance had been by the
utter death of their enemies, and accompanied by stupendous miracle;
no human creatures could in an hour of triumph be surrounded by
circumstances more solemn. I am not going to try to excite your
feelings about them. Consider only for yourself what that seeing of
the Egyptians "dead upon the sea-shore" meant to every soul that saw
it. And then reflect that these intense emotions of mingled horror,
triumph, and gratitude were expressed, in the visible presence of the
Deity, by music and dancing. If you answer that you do not believe the
Egyptians so perished, or that God ever appeared in a pillar of
cloud, I reply, "Be it so&mdash;believe or disbelieve, as you
choose;&mdash;This is yet assuredly the fact, that the author
of the poem or fable of the Exodus supposed that, under such
circumstances of Divine interposition as he had invented, the
triumph of the Israelitish women would have been, and ought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to have been, under the direction of a prophetess, expressed by
music and dancing."</p>

<p>42. Nor was it possible that he should think otherwise, at whatever
period he wrote; both music and dancing being, among all great ancient
nations, an appointed and very principal part of the worship of the
gods.</p>

<p>And that very theatrical entertainment at which I sate thinking over
these things for you&mdash;that pantomime, which depended throughout for
its success on an appeal to the vices of the lower London populace,
was, in itself, nothing but a corrupt remnant of the religious
ceremonies which guided the most serious faiths of the Greek mind, and
laid the foundation of their gravest moral and didactic&mdash;more forcibly
so because at the same time dramatic&mdash;literature.</p>

<p>43. Returning to the Jewish history, you find soon afterwards this
enthusiastic religious dance and song employed, in their more common
and habitual manner, in the idolatries under Sinai; but beautifully
again and tenderly, after the triumph of Jephthah, "And behold his
daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances." Again,
still more notably, at the triumph of David with Saul, "the women came
out of all the cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul
with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music." And you have
this joyful song and dance of the virgins of Israel not only
incidentally alluded to in the most solemn passages of Hebrew
religious poetry (as in Psalm lxviii. 24, 25, and Psalm cxlix. 2, 3),
but approved, and the restoration of it promised as a sign of God's
perfect blessing, most earnestly by the saddest of the Hebrew
prophets, and in one of the most beautiful of all his sayings.</p>

<p>"The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, 'Yea, I have loved
thee with an everlasting love. Therefore, with loving-kindness have I
drawn thee.&mdash;I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O Virgin of
Israel; thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and thou shalt
go forth in dances with them that make merry,'" (Jer. xxxi. 3, 4; and
compare v. 13). And finally, you have in two of quite the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
important passages in the whole series of Scripture (one in the Old
Testament, one in the New), the rejoicing in the repentance from, and
remission of, sins, expressed by means of music and dancing, namely,
in the rapturous dancing of David before the returning ark; and in the
joy of the father's household at the repentance of the prodigal son.</p>

<p>44. I could put all this much better, and more convincingly, before
you, if I were able to take any pains in writing at present; but I am
not, as I told you; being weary and ill; neither do I much care now to
use what, in the very truth, are but tricks of literary art, in
dealing with this so grave subject. You see I write you my letter
straightforward, and let you see all my scratchings out and puttings
in; and if the way I say things shocks you, or any other reader of
these letters, I cannot help it; this only I know, that what I tell
you is true, and written more earnestly than anything I ever wrote
with my best literary care; and that you will find it useful to think
upon, however it be said. Now, therefore, to draw towards our
conclusion. Supposing the Bible inspired, in any of the senses above
defined, you have in these passages a positively Divine authority for
the use of song and dance, as a means of religious service, and
expression of national thanksgiving. Supposing it not inspired, you
have (taking the passages for as slightly authoritative as you choose)
record in them, nevertheless, of a state of mind in a great nation,
producing the most beautiful religious poetry and perfect moral law
hitherto known to us, yet only expressible by them, to the fulfilment
of their joyful passion, by means of professional dance and choral
song.</p>

<p>45. Now I want you to contrast this state of religious rapture with
some of our modern phases of mind in parallel circumstances. You see
that the promise of Jeremiah's, "Thou shalt go forth in the dances of
them that make merry," is immediately followed by this, "Thou shalt
yet <i>plant vines</i> upon the mountains of Samaria." And again, at the
yearly feast to the Lord in Shiloh, the dancing of the virgins was in
the midst of the vineyards (Judges xxi. 21), the feast of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
vintage being in the south, as our harvest home in the north, a peculiar
occasion of joy and thanksgiving. I happened to pass the autumn of
1863 in one of the great vine districts of Switzerland, under the
slopes of the outlying branch of the Jura which limits the arable
plain of the Canton Zurich, some fifteen miles north of Zurich itself.
That city has always been a renowned, stronghold of Swiss
Protestantism, next in importance only to Geneva; and its evangelical
zeal for the conversion of the Catholics of Uri, and endeavors to
bring about that spiritual result by stopping the supplies of salt
they needed to make their cheeses with, brought on (the Uri men
reading their Matt. v. 13, in a different sense) the battle of Keppel,
and the death of the reformer Zwinglius. The town itself shows the
most gratifying signs of progress in all the modern arts and sciences
of life. It is nearly as black as Newcastle&mdash;has a railroad station
larger than the London terminus of the Chatham and Dover&mdash;fouls the
stream of the Limmat as soon as it issues from the lake, so that you
might even venture to compare the formerly simple and innocent Swiss
river (I remember it thirty years ago&mdash;a current of pale green
crystal) with the highly educated English streams of Weare or Tyne;
and, finally, has as many French prints of dissolute tendency in its
principal shop windows as if they had the privilege of opening on the
Parisian Boulevards.</p>

<p>46. I was somewhat anxious to see what species of thanksgiving or
exultation would be expressed at <i>their</i> vintage, by the peasantry in
the neighborhood of this much enlightened, evangelical, and commercial
society. It consisted in two ceremonies only. During the day, the
servants of the farms where the grapes had been gathered, collected in
knots about the vineyards, and slowly fired horse-pistols, from
morning to evening. At night they got drunk, and staggered up and down
the hill paths, uttering, at short intervals, yells and shrieks,
differing only from the howling of wild animals by a certain intended
and insolent discordance, only attainable by the malignity of debased
human creatures.</p>

<p>47. I must not do the injustice to the Zurich peasantry of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
implying that this manner of festivity is peculiar to them. A year before,
in 1862, I had formed the intention of living some years in the
neighborhood of Geneva, and had established myself experimentally on
the eastern slope of the Mont Sal&egrave;ve; but I was forced to abandon
my purpose at last, because I could not endure the rabid howling, on
Sunday evenings, of the holiday-makers who came out from Geneva to get
drunk in the mountain village. By the way, your last letter, with its
extracts about our traffic in gin, is very valuable. I will come to
that part of the business in a little while. Meantime, my friend, note
this, respecting what I have told you, that in the very center of
Europe, in a country which is visited for their chief pleasure by the
most refined and thoughtful persons among all Christian nations&mdash;a
country made by God's hand the most beautiful in the temperate regions
of the earth, and inhabited by a race once capable of the sternest
patriotism and simplest purity of life, your modern religion, in the
very stronghold of it, has reduced the song and dance of ancient
virginal thanksgiving to the howlings and staggerings of men
betraying, in intoxication, a nature sunk more than half-way towards
the beasts; and you will begin to understand why the Bible should have
been "illustrated" by Gustave Dor&eacute;.</p>

<p>48. One word more is needful, though this letter is long already. The
peculiar ghastliness of this Swiss mode of festivity is in its utter
failure of joy; the paralysis and helplessness of a vice in which
there is neither pleasure, nor art. But we are not, throughout Europe,
wholly thus. There is such a thing, yet, as rapturous song and dance
among us, though not indicative, by any means, of joy over repentant
sinners. You must come back to Paris with me again. I had an evening
to spare there, last summer, for investigation of theaters; and as there
was nothing at any of them that I cared much about seeing, I asked a
valet-de-place at Meurice's what people were generally going to. He said,
"All the English went to see the <i>Lanterne Magique</i>." I do not care
to tell you what general entertainment I received in following, for once, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
lead of my countrymen; but it closed with the representation of the
characteristic dancing of all ages of the world; and the dance given
as characteristic of modern time was the Cancan, which you will see
alluded to in the extract given in the note at page 80 of 'Sesame and
Lilies' (the small edition; and page 54 of Vol. I. of the Revised
Series of the Entire Works). "The ball terminated with a Devilish
Chain and a Cancan of Hell, at seven in the morning." It was led by
four principal dancers (who have since appeared in London in the
<i>Huguenot Captain</i>), and it is many years since I have seen such
perfect dancing, as far as finish and accuracy of art and fulness of
animal power and fire are concerned. Nothing could be better done, in
its own evil way, the object of the dance throughout being to express,
in every gesture, the wildest fury of insolence and vicious passions
possible to human creatures. So that you see, though, for the present,
we find ourselves utterly incapable of a rapture of gladness or
thanksgiving, the dance which is presented as characteristic of modern
civilization is still rapturous enough&mdash;but it is with rapture of
blasphemy.</p>

<p class="subhead">THE MEANING AND ACTUAL OPERATION OF SATANIC OR DEMONIACAL INFLUENCE.</p>

<p class="date"><i>March 16, 1867.</i></p>

<p>49. You may gather from the facts given you in my last
letter that, as the expression of true and holy gladness was in
old time statedly offered up by men for a part of worship to
God their Father, so the expression of false and unholy gladness
is in modern times, with as much distinctness and plainness,
asserted by them openly to be offered to another spirit:
"Chain of the Devil," and "Cancan of Hell" being the
names assigned to these modern forms of joyous procession.</p>

<p>Now, you know that, among the best and wisest of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
present religious teachers, there is a gradual tendency to disbelieve,
and to preach their disbelief, in the commonly received ideas of the
Devil, and of his place, and his work. While, among some of our
equally well-meaning, but far less wise, religious teachers, there is,
in consequence, a panic spreading in anticipation of the moral dangers
which must follow on the loss of the help of the Devil. One of the
last appearances in public of the author of the 'Christian Year' was
at a conclave of clergymen assembled in defense of faith in
damnation.<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
The sense of the meeting generally was, that there <i>must</i> be such a
place as hell, because no one would ever behave decently upon earth
unless they were kept in wholesome fear of the fires beneath it: and
Mr. Keble, especially insisting on this view, related a story of an
old woman who had a wicked son, and who, having lately heard with
horror of the teaching of Mr. Maurice and others, exclaimed
pathetically, "My son is bad enough as it is, and if he were not
afraid of hell, what would become of him!" (I write from memory, and
cannot answer for the words, but I can for their purport.)</p>

<p>50. Now, my friend, I am afraid that I must incur the
charge of such presumption as may be involved in variance
from <i>both</i> these systems of teaching.</p>

<p>I do not merely <i>believe</i> there is such a place as hell. I
<i>know</i> there is such a place; and I know also that when men
have got to the point of believing virtue impossible but
through dread of it, they have got <i>into</i> it.</p>

<p>I mean, that according to the distinctness with which they
hold such a creed, the stain of nether fire has passed upon
them. In the depth of his heart Mr. Keble could not have
entertained the thought for an instant; and I believe it was
only as a conspicuous sign to the religious world of the state
into which they were sinking, that this creed, possible in its
sincerity only to the basest of them, was nevertheless appointed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to be uttered by the lips of the most tender, gracious,
and beloved of their teachers.</p>

<p>51. "Virtue impossible but for fear of hell"&mdash;a lofty
creed for your English youth&mdash;and a holy one! And yet, my
friend, there was something of right in the terrors of this
clerical conclave. For, though you should assuredly be able
to hold your own in the straight ways of God, without always
believing that the Devil is at your side, it is a state of mind
much to be dreaded, that you should not <i>know</i> the Devil when
you <i>see</i> him there. For the probability is that when you do
see him, the way you are walking in is not one of God's ways
at all, but is leading you quite into other neighborhoods than
His. On His way, indeed, you may often, like Albert D&uuml;rer's
Knight, see the Fiend behind you, but you will find that
he drops always farther and farther behind; whereas, if he
jogs with you at your side, it is probably one of his own bypaths
you are got on. And, in any case, it is a highly desirable
matter that you should know him when you set eyes
on him, which we are very far from doing in these days, having
convinced ourselves that the graminivorous form of him,
with horn and tail, is extant no longer. But in fearful truth,
the Presence and Power of Him <i>is</i> here; in the world, with
us, and within us, mock as you may; and the fight with him,
for the time, sore, and widely unprosperous.</p>

<p>Do not think I am speaking metaphorically or rhetorically,
or with any other than literal and earnest meaning of words.
Hear me, I pray you, therefore, for a little while, as earnestly
as I speak.</p>

<p>52. Every faculty of man's soul, and every instinct of it
by which he is meant to live, is exposed to its own special
form of corruption: and whether within Man, or in the external
world, there is a power or condition of temptation
which is perpetually endeavoring to reduce every glory of his
soul, and every power of his life, to such corruption as is
possible to them. And the more beautiful they are, the more
fearful is the death which is attached as a penalty to their
degradation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
53. Take, for instance, that which, in its purity, is the
source of the highest and purest mortal happiness&mdash;Love.
Think of it first at its highest&mdash;as it may exist in the disciplined
spirit of a perfect human creature; as it has so existed
again and again, and does always, wherever it truly exists at
all, as the <i>purifying</i> passion of the soul. I will not speak of
the transcendental and imaginative intensity in which it may
reign in noble hearts, as when it inspired the greatest religious
poem yet given to men; but take it in its true and quiet purity
in any simple lover's heart,&mdash;as you have it expressed, for instance,
thus, exquisitely, in the 'Angel in the House':&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"And there, with many a blissful tear,<br />
I vowed to love and prayed to wed<br />
The maiden who had grown so dear;&mdash;<br />
Thanked God, who had set her in my path;<br />
And promised, as I hoped to win,<br />
I never would sully my faith<br />
By the least selfishness or sin;<br />
Whatever in her sight I'd seem<br />
I'd really be; I ne'er would blend,<br />
With my delight in her, a dream<br />
'Twould change her cheek to comprehend;<br />
And, if she wished it, would prefer<br />
Another's to my own success;<br />
And always seek the best for her<br />
With unofficious tenderness."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Take this for the pure type of it in its simplicity; and then
think of what corruption this passion is capable. I will give
you a type of that also, and at your very doors. I cannot refer
you to the time when the crime happened; but it was some
four or five years ago, near Newcastle, and it has remained
always as a ghastly landmark in my mind, owing to the horror
of the external circumstances. The body of the murdered
woman was found naked, rolled into a heap of ashes, at the
mouth of one of your pits.</p>

<p>54. You have thus two limiting examples, of the Pure Passion,
and of its corruption. Now, whatever influence it is,
without or within us, which has a tendency to degrade the one
towards the other, is literally and accurately "Satanic."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
And this treacherous or deceiving spirit is perpetually at
work, so that all the worst evil among us is a betrayed or corrupted
good. Take religion itself: the desire of finding out
God, and placing one's self in some true son's or servant's
relation to Him. The Devil, that is to say, the deceiving
spirit within us, or outside of us, mixes up our own vanity
with this desire; makes us think that in our love to God we
have established some connection with Him which separates
us from our fellow-men, and renders us superior to them.
Then it takes but one wave of the Devil's hand; and we are
burning them alive for taking the liberty of contradicting us.</p>

<p>55. Take the desire of teaching&mdash;the entirely unselfish and
noble instinct for telling to those who are ignorant, the truth
we know, and guarding them from the errors we see them in
danger of;&mdash;there is no nobler, no more constant instinct in
honorable breasts; but let the Devil formalize it, and mix the
pride of a profession with it&mdash;get foolish people entrusted
with the business of instruction, and make their giddy heads
giddier by putting them up in pulpits above a submissive
crowd&mdash;and you have it instantly corrupted into its own reverse;
you have an alliance <i>against</i> the light, shrieking at the
sun, and the moon, and stars, as profane spectra:&mdash;a company
of the blind, beseeching those they lead to remain blind also.
"The heavens and the lights that rule them are untrue; the
laws of creation are treacherous; the poles of the earth are
out of poise. But <i>we</i> are true. Light is in us only. Shut
your eyes close and fast, and we will lead you."</p>

<p>56. Take the desire and faith of mutual help; the virtue
of vowed brotherhood for the accomplishment of common
purpose, (without which nothing great can be wrought by
multitudinous bands of men); let the Devil put pride of caste
into it, and you have a military organization applied for a
thousand years to maintain that higher caste in idleness by
robbing the laboring poor; let the Devil put a few small personal
interests into it, and you have all faithful deliberation
on national law rendered impossible in the parliaments of Europe,
by the antagonism of parties.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
57. Take the instinct for justice, and the natural sense of
indignation against crime; let the Devil color it with personal
passion, and you have a mighty race of true and tender-hearted
men living for centuries in such bloody feud that
every note and word of their national songs is a dirge, and
every rock of their hills is a gravestone. Take the love of
beauty, and power of imagination, which are the source of
every true achievement in art; let the Devil touch them with
sensuality, and they are stronger than the sword or the flame
to blast the cities where they were born, into ruin without
hope. Take the instinct of industry and ardor of commerce,
which are meant to be the support and mutual maintenance
of man; let the Devil touch them with avarice, and you shall
see the avenues of the exchange choked with corpses that have
died of famine.</p>

<p>58. Now observe&mdash;I leave you to call this deceiving spirit what
you like&mdash;or to theorize about it as you like. All that I desire
you to recognize is the fact of its being here, and the need of its
being fought with. If you take the Bible's account of it, or Dante's,
or Milton's, you will receive the image of it as a mighty spiritual
creature, commanding others, and resisted by others: if you take
&AElig;schylus's or Hesiod's account of it, you will hold it for a
partly elementary and unconscious adversity of fate, and partly for a
group of monstrous spiritual agencies connected with death, and
begotten out of the dust; if you take a modern rationalist's, you will
accept it for a mere treachery and want of vitality in our own moral
nature exposing it to loathsomeness or moral disease, as the body is
capable of mortification or leprosy. I do not care what you call
it,&mdash;whose history you believe of it,&mdash;nor what you
yourself can imagine about it; the origin, or nature, or name may
be as you will, but the deadly reality of the thing is with us, and
warring against us, and on our true war with it depends whatever
life we can win. Deadly reality, I say. The puff-adder or horned
asp is not more real. Unbelievable,&mdash;<i>those</i>,&mdash;unless
you had seen them; no fable could have been coined out of any
human brain so dreadful, within its own poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
material sphere, as that blue-lipped serpent&mdash;working its way
sidelong in the sand. As real, but with sting of eternal death&mdash;this
worm that dies not, and fire that is not quenched,
within our souls or around them. Eternal death, I say&mdash;sure,
that, whatever creed you hold;&mdash;if the old Scriptural
one, Death of perpetual banishment from before God's face;
if the modern rationalist one, Death Eternal for <i>us</i>, instant
and unredeemable ending of lives wasted in misery.</p>

<p>This is what this unquestionably present&mdash;this, according
to his power, <i>omni</i>-present&mdash;fiend, brings us towards, daily.
He is the person to be "voted" against, my working friend;
it is worth something, having a vote against <i>him</i>, if you can
get it! Which you can, indeed; but not by gift from Cabinet
Ministers; you must work warily with your own hands, and
drop sweat of heart's blood, before you can record that vote
effectually.</p>

<p>Of which more in next letter.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XI" id="LETTER_XI"></a>LETTER XI.</h2>

<p class="subhead">THE SATANIC POWER IS MAINLY TWOFOLD: THE POWER OF
CAUSING FALSEHOOD AND THE POWER OF CAUSING PAIN.
THE RESISTANCE IS BY LAW OF HONOR AND LAW OF DELIGHT.</p>

<p class="date"><i>March 19, 1857.</i></p>

<p>59. You may perhaps have thought my last three or four
letters mere rhapsodies. They are nothing of the kind; they
are accurate accounts of literal facts, which we have to deal
with daily. This thing, or power, opposed to God's power,
and specifically called "Mammon" in the Sermon on the
Mount, is, in deed and in truth, a continually present and
active enemy, properly called "<i>Arch</i>-enemy," that is to say,
"Beginning and Prince of Enemies," and daily we have to
record our vote for, or against him. Of the manner of which
record we were next to consider.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
60. This enemy is always recognizable, briefly in two functions.
He is pre-eminently the Lord of <i>Lies</i> and the Lord of
<i>Pain</i>. Wherever Lies are, he is; wherever Pain is, he has
been&mdash;so that of the Spirit of Wisdom (who is called God's
Helper, as Satan His Adversary) it is written, not only that
by her Kings reign, and Princes decree justice, but also that
her ways are ways of Pleasantness, and all her paths Peace.</p>

<p>Therefore, you will succeed, you working men, in recording
your votes against this arch-enemy, precisely in the degree in
which you can do away with falsehood and pain in your work
and lives; and bring truth into the one, and pleasure into the
other; all education being directed to make yourselves and
your children <i>capable of Honesty</i> and <i>capable of Delight</i>;
and to rescue yourselves from iniquity and agony. And this is
what I meant by saying in the preface to 'Unto this Last'
that the central requirement of education consisted in giving
habits of gentleness and justice; "gentleness" (as I will
show you presently) being the best single word I could have
used to express the capacity for giving and receiving true
pleasure; and "justice" being similarly the most comprehensive
word for all kind of honest dealing.</p>

<p>61. Now, I began these letters with the purpose of explaining
the nature of the requirements of justice first, and then
those of gentleness, but I allowed myself to be led into that
talk about the theaters, not only because the thoughts could
be more easily written as they came, but also because I was
able thus to illustrate for you more directly the nature of
the enemy we have to deal with. You do not perhaps know,
though I say this diffidently (for I often find working men
know many things which one would have thought were out of
their way), that music was, among the Greeks, quite the first
means of education; and that it was so connected with their
system of ethics and of intellectual training, that the God of
Music is with them also the God of Righteousness;&mdash;the God
who purges and avenges iniquity, and contends with their
Satan as represented under the form of Python, "the corrupter."
And the Greeks were incontrovertibly right in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
this. Music is the nearest at hand, the most orderly, the
most delicate, and the most perfect, of all bodily pleasures;
it is also the only one which is equally helpful to all the ages
of man,&mdash;helpful from the nurse's song to her infant, to the
music, unheard of others, which so often haunts the deathbed
of pure and innocent spirits. And the action of the deceiving
or devilish power is in <i>nothing</i> shown quite so distinctly
among us at this day,&mdash;not even in our commercial dishonesties,
nor in our social cruelties,&mdash;as in its having been able
to take away music, as an instrument of education, altogether;
and to enlist it almost wholly in the service of superstition
on the one hand, and of sensuality on the other.</p>

<p>62. This power of the Muses, then, and its proper influence over you
workmen, I shall eventually have much to insist upon with you; and in
doing so I shall take that beautiful parable of the Prodigal Son
(which I have already referred to), and explain, as far as I know, the
significance of it, and then I will take the three means of festivity,
or wholesome human joy, therein stated,&mdash;fine dress, rich food,
and music;&mdash;("bring forth the fairest robe for him,"&mdash;"bring
forth the fatted calf, and kill it;" "as he drew nigh, he heard music
and dancing"); and I will show you how all these three things, fine
dress, rich food, and music (including ultimately all the other arts)
are meant to be sources of life, and means of moral discipline, to all
men; and how they have all three been made, by the Devil, the means of
guilt, dissoluteness, and death.<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id="FNanchor_A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_6" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
But first I must return to my original plan of these letters, and
endeavor to set down for you some of the laws which, in a true Working
Men's Parliament, must be ordained in defense of Honesty.</p>

<p>Of which laws (preliminary to all others, and necessary above all
others), having now somewhat got my raveled threads together again, I
will begin talk in my next letter.</p>

<p class="subhead">THE NECESSITY OF IMPERATIVE LAW TO THE PROSPERITY OF STATES.</p>

<p class="date"><i>March 20, 1867.</i></p>

<p>63. I have your most interesting letter,<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#APPENDIX_IV" class="fnanchor">[IV]</a>
which I keep for reference, when I come to the consideration of its
subject in its proper place, under the head of the abuse of Food. I do
not wonder that your life should be rendered unhappy by the scenes of
drunkenness which you are so often compelled to witness; nor that this
so gigantic and infectious evil should seem to you the root of the
greater part of the misery of our lower orders. I do not wonder that
George Cruikshank has warped the entire current of his thoughts and
life, at once to my admiration and my sorrow, from their natural field
of work, that he might spend them, in struggle with this fiend, for
the poor lowest people whom he knows so well. I wholly sympathize with
you in indignation at the methods of temptation employed, and at the
use of the fortunes made by the vendors of death; and whatever
immediately applicable legal means there might be of restricting the
causes of drunkenness, I should without hesitation desire to bring
into operation. But all such appliance I consider temporary and
provisionary; nor, while there is record of the miracle at Cana (not
to speak of the sacrament) can I conceive it possible, without
(logically) the denial of the entire truth of the New Testament, to
reprobate the use of wine as a stimulus to the powers of life.
Supposing we did deny the words and deeds of the Founder of
Christianity, the authority of the wisest heathens, especially that of
Plato in the 'Laws,' is wholly against abstinence from wine; and much
as I can believe, and as I have been endeavoring to make you believe
also, of the subtlety of the Devil, I do not suppose the vine to have
been one of his inventions. Of this, however, more in another place.
By the way, was it not curious that in the 'Manchester Examiner,'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in which that letter of mine on the abuse of dancing appeared, there
chanced to be, in the next column, a paragraph giving an account of a
girl stabbing her betrayer in a ball-room; and another paragraph
describing a Parisian character, which gives exactly the extreme
type I wanted, for example of the abuse of
Food?<a name="FNanchor_B_8" id="FNanchor_B_8"></a><a href="#APPENDIX_V" class="fnanchor">[V]</a></p>

<p>64. I return, however, now to the examination of possible
means for the enforcement of justice, in temper and in act,
as the first of political requirements. And as, in stating my
conviction of the necessity of certain stringent laws on this
matter, I shall be in direct opposition to Mr. Stuart Mill;
and, more or less, in opposition to other professors of modern
political economy, as well as to many honest and active promoters
of the privileges of working men (as if privilege only
were wanted and never restraint!), I will give you, as briefly
as I can, the grounds on which I am prepared to justify such
opposition.</p>

<p>65. When the crew of a wrecked ship escape in an open
boat, and the boat is crowded, the provisions scanty, and the
prospect of making land distant, laws are instantly established
and enforced which no one thinks of disobeying. An entire
equality of claim to the provisions is acknowledged without
dispute; and an equal liability to necessary labor. No man
who can row is allowed to refuse his oar; no man, however
much money he may have saved in his pocket, is allowed so
much as half a biscuit beyond his proper ration. Any riotous
person who endangered the safety of the rest would be bound,
and laid in the bottom of the boat, without the smallest compunction,
for such violation of the principles of individual
liberty; and, on the other hand, any child, or woman, or aged
person, who was helpless, and exposed to great danger and
suffering by their weakness, would receive more than ordinary
care and indulgence, not unaccompanied with unanimous self-sacrifice
on the part of the laboring crew.</p>

<p>There is never any question under circumstances like these,
of what is right and wrong, worthy and unworthy, wise or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
foolish. If there <i>be</i> any question, there is little hope for boat
or crew. The right man is put at the helm; every available
hand is set to the oars; the sick are tended, and the vicious
restrained, at once, and decisively; or if not, the end is near.</p>

<p>66. Now, the circumstances of every associated group of
human society, contending bravely for national honors and
felicity of life, differ only from those thus supposed, in the
greater, instead of less, necessity for the establishment of restraining
law. There is no point of difference in the difficulties
to be met, nor in the rights reciprocally to be exercised.
Vice and indolence are not less, but more, injurious in a nation
than in a boat's company; the modes in which they affect
the interests of worthy persons being far more complex, and
more easily concealed. The right of restraint, vested in those
who labor, over those who would impede their labor, is as absolute
in the large as in the small society; the equal claim
to share in whatever is necessary to the common life (or commonwealth)
is as indefeasible; the claim of the sick and helpless
to be cared for by the strong with earnest self-sacrifice,
is as pitiful and as imperative; the necessity that the governing
authority should be in the hands of a true and trained
pilot is as clear and as constant. In none of these conditions
is there any difference between a nation and a boat's company.
The only difference is in this, that the impossibility of discerning
the effects of individual error and crime, or of counteracting
them by individual effort, in the affairs of a great
nation renders it tenfold more necessary than in a small society
that direction by law should be sternly established. Assume
that your boat's crew is disorderly and licentious, and
will, by agreement, submit to no order;&mdash;the most troublesome
of them will yet be easily discerned; and the chance is
that the best man among them knocks him down. Common
instinct of self-preservation will make the rioters put a good
sailor at the helm, and impulsive pity and occasional help will
be, by heart and hand, here and there given to visible distress.
Not so in the ship of the realm. The most troublesome
persons in <i>it</i> are usually the least recognized for such,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and the most active in its management; the best men mind
their own business patiently, and are never thought of; the
good helmsman never touches the tiller but in the last extremity;
and the worst forms of misery are hidden, not only
from every eye, but from every thought. On the deck, the
aspect is of Cleopatra's galley&mdash;under hatches there is a slave
hospital; while, finally (and this is the most fatal difference
of all), even the few persons who care to interfere energetically,
with purpose of doing good, can, in a large society, discern
so little of the real state of evil to be dealt with, and
judge so little of the best means of dealing with it, that half
of their best efforts will be misdirected, and some may even
do more harm than good. Whereas it is the sorrowful law
of this universe, that evil, even unconscious and unintended,
never fails of <i>its</i> effect; and in a state where the evil and the
good, under conditions of individual "liberty," are allowed
to contend together, not only every <i>stroke</i> on the Devil's side
tells&mdash;but every <i>slip</i>, (the mistakes of wicked men being as
mischievous as their successes); while on the side of right,
there will be much direct and fatal defeat, and, even of its
measure of victory, half will be fruitless.</p>

<p>67. It is true, of course, that, in the end of ends, nothing
but the right conquers; the prevalent thorns of wrong, at last,
crackle away in indiscriminate flame: and of the good seed
sown, one grain in a thousand some day comes up&mdash;and somebody
lives by it; but most of our great teachers, not excepting
Carlyle and Emerson themselves, are a little too encouraging
in their proclamation of this comfort, not, to my mind, very
sufficient, when for the present our fields are full of nothing
but darnel instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley;
and none of them seem to me yet to have enough insisted on
the inevitable power and infectiousness of all evil, and the
easy and utter extinguishableness of good. Medicine often
fails of its effect&mdash;but poison never: and while, in summing
the observation of past life, not unwatchfully spent, I can
truly say that I have a thousand times seen patience disappointed
of her hope, and wisdom of her aim, I have never yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
seen folly fruitless of mischief, nor vice conclude but in
calamity.</p>

<p>68. There is, however, one important condition in national
economy, in which the analogy of that of a ship's company is
incomplete: namely, that while labor at oar or sail is necessarily
united, and can attain no independent good, or personal
profit, the labor properly undertaken by the several
members of a political community is necessarily, and justly,
within certain limits, independent; and obtains for them independent
advantage, of which, if you will glance at the last
paragraph of the first chapter of 'Munera Pulveris,' you will
see I should be the last person to propose depriving them.
This great difference in final condition involves necessarily
much complexity in the system and application of general
laws; but it in no wise abrogates,&mdash;on the contrary, it renders
yet more imperative,&mdash;the necessity for the firm ordinance of
such laws, which, marking the due limits of independent
agency, may enable it to exist in full energy, not only without
becoming injurious, but so as more variously and perfectly to
promote the entire interests of the commonwealth.</p>

<p>I will address myself therefore in my next letter to the
statement of some of these necessary laws.</p>

<p class="subhead">THE PROPER OFFICES OF THE BISHOP AND DUKE; OR, "OVERSEER"
AND "LEADER."</p>

<p class="date"><i>March 21, 1867.</i></p>

<p>69. I see, by your last letter, for which I heartily thank
you, that you would not sympathize with me in my sorrow
for the desertion of his own work by George Cruikshank, that
he may fight in the front of the temperance ranks. But you
do not know what work he has left undone, nor how much
richer inheritance you might have received from his hand. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
was no more <i>his</i> business to etch diagrams of drunkenness
than it is mine at this moment to be writing these letters
against anarchy. It is "the first mild day of March" (high
time, I think, that it should be!), and by rights I ought to
be out among the budding banks and hedges, outlining sprays
of hawthorn and clusters of primrose. That is <i>my</i> right
work; and it is not, in the inner gist and truth of it, right nor
good, for you, or for anybody else, that Cruikshank with his
great gift, and I with my weak, but yet thoroughly clear and
definite one, should both of us be tormented by agony of indignation
and compassion, till we are forced to give up our
peace, and pleasure, and power; and rush down into the
streets and lanes of the city, to do the little that is in the
strength of our single hands against their uncleanliness and
iniquity. But, as in a sorely besieged town, every man must
to the ramparts, whatsoever business he leaves, so neither he
nor I have had any choice but to leave our household stuff,
and go on crusade, such as we are called to; not that I mean,
if Fate may be anywise resisted, to give up the strength of
my life, as he has given his; for I think he was wrong in
doing so; and that he should only have carried the fiery cross
his appointed leagues, and then given it to another hand;
and, for my own part, I mean these very letters to close my
political work for many a day; and I write them, not in any
hope of their being at present listened to, but to disburthen
my heart of the witness I have to bear, that I may be free to
go back to my garden lawns, and paint birds and flowers there.</p>

<p>70. For these same statutes which we are to consider to-day,
have indeed been in my mind now these fourteen
years, ever since I wrote the last volume of the 'Stones of
Venice,' in which you will find, in the long note on Modern
Education, most of what I have been now in detail writing
to you, hinted in abstract; and, at the close of it, this sentence,
of which I solemnly now avouch (in thankfulness that
I was permitted to write it), every word: "Finally, I hold
it for indisputable, that the first duty of a State is to see that
every child born therein shall be well housed, clothed, fed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
educated, till it attain years of discretion. But in order to
the effecting this the Government must have an authority over
the people of which we now do not so much as dream."</p>

<p>That authority I did not then endeavor to define, for I
knew all such assertions would be useless, and that the necessarily
resultant outcry would merely diminish my influence in
other directions. But now I do not care about influence any
more, it being only my concern to say truly that which I
know, and, if it may be, get some quiet life, yet, among the
fields in the evening shadow.</p>

<p>71. There is, I suppose, no word which men are prouder of
the right to attach to their names, or more envious of others
who bear it, when they themselves may not, than the word
"noble." Do you know what it originally meant, and always,
in the right use of it, means? It means a "known"
person; one who has risen far enough above others to draw
men's eyes to him, and to be known (honorably) for such and
such an one. "Ignoble," on the other hand, is derived from
the same root as the word "ignorance." It means an unknown,
inglorious person. And no more singular follies have
been committed by weak human creatures than those which
have been caused by the instinct, pure and simple, of escaping
from this obscurity. Instinct, which, corrupted, will hesitate
at no means, good or evil, of satisfying itself with notoriety&mdash;instinct,
nevertheless, which, like all other natural ones, has a
true and pure purpose, and ought always in a worthy way
to be satisfied.</p>

<p>All men ought to be in this sense "noble"; known of each
other, and desiring to be known. And the first law which a
nation, desiring to conquer all the devices of the Father of
Lies, should establish among its people, is that they <i>shall</i> be
so known.</p>

<p>72. Will you please now read &sect; 22 of 'Sesame and Lilies'?
The reviewers in the ecclesiastical journals laughed at it,
as a rhapsody, when the book came out; none having the
slightest notion of what I meant: (nor, indeed, do I well see
how it could be otherwise!). Nevertheless, I meant precisely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and literally what is there said, namely, that a bishop's duty
being to watch over the souls of his people, and <i>give</i> account
of every one of them, it becomes practically necessary for
him first to <i>get</i> some account of their bodies. Which he was
wont to do in the early days of Christianity by help of a person
called "deacon" or "ministering servant," whose name
is still retained among preliminary ecclesiastical dignities,
vainly enough! Putting, however, all questions of forms and
names aside, the thing actually needing to be done is this&mdash;that
over every hundred (more or less) of the families composing
a Christian State, there should be appointed an overseer,
or bishop, to render account, to the State, of the life
of every individual in those families; and to have care both
of their interest and conduct to such an extent as they may
be willing to admit, or as their faults may justify: so that it
may be impossible for any person, however humble, to suffer
from unknown want, or live in unrecognized crime;&mdash;such
help and observance being rendered without officiousness
either of interference or inquisition (the limits of both being
determined by national law), but with the patient and gentle
watchfulness which true Christian pastors now exercise over
their flocks; only with a higher legal authority presently to
be defined, of interference on due occasion.</p>

<p>And with this farther function, that such overseers shall
be not only the pastors, but the biographers, of their people;
a written statement of the principal events in the life of
each family being annually required to be rendered by them
to a superior State Officer. These records, laid up in public
offices, would soon furnish indications of the families whom
it would be advantageous to the nation to advance in position,
or distinguish with honor, and aid by such reward as it
should be the object of every Government to distribute no
less punctually, and far more frankly, than it distributes
punishment: (compare 'Munera Pulveris,' Essay IV., in
paragraph on Critic Law), while the mere fact of permanent
record being kept of every event of importance, whether disgraceful
or worthy of praise, in each family, would of itself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
be a deterrent from crime, and a stimulant to well-deserving
conduct, far beyond mere punishment or reward.</p>

<p>73. Nor need you think that there would be anything in
such a system un-English, or tending to espionage. No uninvited
visits should ever be made in any house, unless law
had been violated; nothing recorded, against its will, of any
family, but what was inevitably known of its publicly visible
conduct, and the results of that conduct. What else was written
should be only by the desire, and from the communications,
of its head. And in a little while it would come to be
felt that the true history of a nation was indeed not of its
wars, but of its households; and the desire of men would
rather be to obtain some conspicuous place in these honorable
annals, than to shrink behind closed shutters from public
sight. Until at last, George Herbert's grand word of command
would hold not only on the conscience, but the actual
system and outer economy of life,</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Think the King sees thee still, for <i>his</i> King does."
</p></div>

<p>74. Secondly, above these bishops or pastors, who are only
to be occupied in offices of familiar supervision and help,
should be appointed higher officers of State, having executive
authority over as large districts as might be conveniently (according
to the number and circumstances of their inhabitants)
committed to their care; officers who, according to the
reports of the pastors, should enforce or mitigate the operation
of too rigid general law, and determine measures exceptionally
necessary for public advantage. For instance, the general
law being that all children of the operative classes, at
a certain age, should be sent to public schools, these superior
officers should have power, on the report of the pastors, to
dispense with the attendance of children who had sick parents
to take charge of, or whose home-life seemed to be one of
better advantage for them than that of the common schools;
or who, for any other like cause, might justifiably claim remission.
And it being the general law that the entire body
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of the public should contribute to the cost, and divide the
profits, of all necessary public works and undertakings, as
roads, mines, harbor protections, and the like, and that nothing
of this kind should be permitted to be in the hands of
private speculators, it should be the duty of the district officer
to collect whatever information was accessible respecting such
sources of public profit; and to represent the circumstances
in Parliament: and then, with Parliamentary authority, but
on his own sole personal responsibility, to see that such enterprises
were conducted honestly and with due energy and
order.</p>

<p>The appointment to both these offices should be by election,
and for life; by what forms of election shall be matter of
inquiry, after we have determined some others of the necessary
constitutional laws.</p>

<p>75. I do not doubt but that you are already beginning to
think it was with good reason I held my peace these fourteen
years,&mdash;and that, for any good likely to be done by speaking,
I might as well have held it altogether!</p>

<p>It may be so: but merely to complete and explain my own
work, it is necessary that I should say these things finally;
and I believe that the imminent danger to which we are now
in England exposed by the gradually accelerated fall of our
aristocracy (wholly their own fault), and the substitution of
money-power for their martial one; and by the correspondingly
imminent prevalence of mob violence here, as in America;
together with the continually increasing chances of insane
war, founded on popular passion, whether of pride, fear,
or acquisitiveness,&mdash;all these dangers being further darkened
and degraded by the monstrous forms of vice and selfishness
which the appliances of recent wealth, and of vulgar mechanical
art, make possible to the million,&mdash;will soon bring
us into a condition in which men will be glad to listen to
almost any words but those of a demagogue, and to seek any
means of safety rather than those in which they have lately
trusted. So, with your good leave, I will say my say to the
end, mock at it who may.</p>

<p class="subhead">THE FIRST GROUP OF ESSENTIAL LAWS&mdash;AGAINST THEFT BY
FALSE WORK, AND BY BANKRUPTCY.&mdash;NECESSARY PUBLICITY
OF ACCOUNTS.</p>

<p class="date"><i>March 26, 1867.</i></p>

<p>76. I feel much inclined to pause at this point, to answer
the kind of questions and objections which I know must be
rising in your mind, respecting the authority supposed to
be lodged in the persons of the officers just specified. But I
can neither define, nor justify to you, the powers I would
desire to see given to them, till I state to you the kind of laws
they would have to enforce: of which the first group should
be directed to the prevention of all kinds of thieving; but
chiefly of the occult and polite methods of it; and, of all
occult methods, chiefly, the making and selling of bad goods.
No form of theft is so criminal as this&mdash;none so deadly to
the State. If you break into a man's house and steal a hundred
pounds' worth of plate, he knows his loss, and there
is an end (besides that you take your risk of punishment for
your gain, like a man). And if you do it bravely and openly,
and habitually live by such inroad, you may retain nearly
every moral and manly virtue, and become a heroic rider and
reiver, and hero of song. But if you swindle me out of
twenty shillings' worth of quality on each of a hundred bargains,
I lose my hundred pounds all the same, and I get a
hundred untrustworthy articles besides, which will fail me
and injure me in all manner of ways, when I least expect it;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and you, having done your thieving basely, are corrupted by
the guilt of it to the very heart's core.</p>

<p>77. This is the first thing, therefore, which your general
laws must be set to punish, fiercely, immitigably, to the
utter prevention and extinction of it, or there is no hope for
you. No religion that ever was preached on this earth of
God's rounding ever proclaimed any salvation to sellers of
bad goods. If the Ghost that is in you, whatever the essence
of it, leaves your hand a juggler's, and your heart a cheat's,
it is not a Holy Ghost, be assured of that. And for the rest,
all political economy, as well as all higher virtue, depends
<i>first on sound work</i>.</p>

<p>Let your laws, then, I say, in the beginning, be set to secure
this. You cannot make punishment too stern for subtle
knavery. Keep no truce with this enemy, whatever pardon
you extend to more generous ones. For light weights and
false measures, or for proved adulteration or dishonest manufacture
of article, the penalty should be simply confiscation of
goods and sending out of the country. The kind of person
who desires prosperity by such practices could not be made to
"emigrate" too speedily. What to do with him in the place
you appoint to be blessed by his presence, we will in time consider.</p>

<p>78. Under such penalty, however, and yet more under the
pressure of such a right public opinion as could pronounce
and enforce such penalty, I imagine that sham articles would
become speedily as rare as sound ones are now. The chief
difficulty in the matter would be to fix your standard. This
would have to be done by the guild of every trade in its own
manner, and within certain easily recognizable limits, and
this fixing of standard would necessitate much simplicity in
the forms and kinds of articles sold. You could only warrant
a certain kind of glazing or painting in china, a certain
quality of leather or cloth, bricks of a certain clay, loaves
of a defined mixture of meal. Advisable improvements or
varieties in manufacture would have to be examined and
accepted by the trade guild: when so accepted, they would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
be announced in public reports; and all puffery and self-proclamation,
on the part of tradesmen, absolutely forbidden,
as much as the making of any other kind of noise or disturbance.</p>

<p>79. But observe, this law is only to have force over tradesmen
whom I suppose to have joined voluntarily in carrying
out a better system of commerce. Outside of their guild,
they would have to leave the rogue to puff and cheat as he
chose, and the public to be gulled as they chose. All that is
necessary is that the said public should clearly know the shops
in which they could get warranted articles; and, as clearly,
those in which they bought at their own risk.</p>

<p>And the above-named penalty of confiscation of goods
should of course be enforced only against dishonest members
of the trade guild. If people chose to buy of those
who had openly refused to join an honest society, they should
be permitted to do so, at their pleasure, and peril: and this
for two reasons,&mdash;the first, that it is always necessary, in enacting
strict law, to leave some safety valve for outlet of irrepressible
vice (nearly all the stern lawgivers of old time
erred by oversight in this; so that the morbid elements of the
State, which it should be allowed to get rid of in a cutaneous
and openly curable manner, were thrown inwards, and corrupted
its constitution, and broke all down);&mdash;the second,
that operations of trade and manufacture conducted under,
and guarded by, severe law, ought always to be subject to the
stimulus of such erratic external ingenuity as cannot be
tested by law, or would be hindered from its full exercise by
the dread of it; not to speak of the farther need of extending
all possible indulgence to foreign traders who might wish to
exercise their industries here without liability to the surveillance
of our trade guilds.</p>

<p>80. Farther, while for all articles warranted by the guild
(as above supposed) the prices should be annually fixed for
the trade throughout the kingdom; and the producing workman's
wages fixed, so as to define the master's profits within
limits admitting only such variation as the nature of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
given article of sale rendered inevitable;&mdash;yet, in the production
of other classes of articles, whether by skill of applied
handicraft, or fineness of material above the standard of the
guild, attaining, necessarily, values above its assigned prices,
every firm should be left free to make its own independent
efforts and arrangements with its workmen, subject always to
the same penalty, if it could be proved to have consistently
described, or offered, anything to the public for what it was
not: and finally, the state of the affairs of every firm should
be annually reported to the guild, and its books laid open to
inspection, for guidance in the regulation of prices in the
subsequent year; and any firm whose liabilities exceeded its
assets by a hundred pounds should be forthwith declared
bankrupt. And I will anticipate what I have to say in succeeding
letters so far as to tell you that I would have this condition
extend to every firm in the country, large or small,
and of whatever rank in business. And thus you perceive,
my friend, I shall not have to trouble you or myself much
with deliberations respecting commercial "panics," nor to
propose legislative cures for <i>them</i>, by any laxatives or purgatives
of paper currency, or any other change of pecuniary
diet.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XV" id="LETTER_XV"></a>LETTER XV.</h2>

<p class="subhead">THE NATURE OF THEFT BY UNJUST PROFITS.&mdash;CRIME CAN
FINALLY BE ARRESTED ONLY BY EDUCATION.</p>

<p class="date"><i>29th March.</i></p>

<p>81. The first methods of polite robbery, by dishonest manufacture
and by debt, of which we have been hitherto speaking,
are easily enough to be dealt with and ended, when
once men have a mind to end them. But the third method
of polite robbery, by dishonest <i>acquisition</i>, has many branches,
and is involved among honest arts of acquisition, so that it is
difficult to repress the one without restraining the other.</p>

<p>Observe, first, large fortunes cannot honestly be made by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the work of any <i>one</i> man's hands, or head. If his work benefits
multitudes, and involves position of high trust, it may be
(I do not say that it <i>is</i>) expedient to reward him with great
wealth or estate; but fortune of this kind is freely given in
gratitude for benefit, not as repayment for labor. Also, men
of peculiar genius in any art, if the public can enjoy the product
of their genius, may set it at almost any price they
choose; but this, I will show you when I come to speak of art,
is unlawful on their part and ruinous to their own powers.
Genius must not be sold; the sale of it involves, in a transcendental,
but perfectly true, sense, the guilt both of simony
and prostitution. Your labor only may be sold; your soul
must not.</p>

<p>82. Now, by fair pay for fair labor, according to the rank
of it, a man can obtain means of comfortable, or if he needs
it, refined life. But he cannot obtain large fortune. Such
fortunes as are now the prizes of commerce can be made only
in one of three ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) By obtaining command over the labor of multitudes
of other men and taxing it for our own profit.</p>

<p>(2.) By treasure-trove,&mdash;as of mines, useful vegetable products,
and the like,&mdash;in circumstances putting them under
our own exclusive control.</p>

<p>(3.) By speculation, (commercial gambling).</p>

<p>The first two of these means of obtaining riches are, in
some forms and within certain limits, lawful, and advantageous
to the State. The third is entirely detrimental to it;
for in all cases of profit derived from speculation, at best,
what one man gains another loses; and the net results to the
State is zero, (pecuniarily,) with the loss of the time and
ingenuity spent in the transaction; besides the disadvantage
involved in the discouragement of the losing party, and the
corrupted moral natures of both. This is the result of speculation
at its best. At its worst, not only B loses what A gains
(having taken his fair risk of such loss for his fair chance
of gain), but C and D, who never had any chance at all, are
drawn in by B's fall, and the final result is that A sets up his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
carriage on the collected sum which was once the means of
living to a dozen families.</p>

<p>83. Nor is this all. For while real commerce is founded
on real necessities or uses, and limited by these, speculation,
of which the object is merely gain, seeks to excite imaginary
necessities and popular desires, in order to gather its temporary
profit from the supply of them. So that not only the
persons who lend their money to it will be finally robbed, but
the work done with their money will be, for the most part,
useless, and thus the entire body of the public injured as
well as the persons concerned in the transaction. Take,
for instance, the architectural decorations of railways throughout
the kingdom,&mdash;representing many millions of money for
which no farthing of dividend can ever be forthcoming. The
public will not be induced to pay the smallest fraction of
higher fare to Rochester or Dover because the ironwork of
the bridge which carries them over the Thames is covered
with floral cockades, and the piers of it edged with ornamental
cornices. All that work is simply put there by the builders
that they may put the percentage upon it into their own
pockets; and, the rest of the money being thrown into that
floral form, there is an end of it, as far as the shareholders
are concerned. Millions upon millions have thus been spent,
within the last twenty years, on ornamental arrangements
of zigzag bricks, black and blue tiles, cast-iron foliage, and
the like; of which millions, as I said, not a penny can ever
return into the shareholders' pockets, nor contribute to public
speed or safety on the line. It is all sunk forever in ornamental
architecture, and (trust me for this!) <i>all that architecture
is bad</i>. As such, it had incomparably better not have
been built. Its only result will be to corrupt what capacity
of taste or right pleasure in such work we have yet left to
us! And consider a little, what other kind of result than that
might have been attained if all those millions had been spent
usefully: say, in buying land for the people, or building
good houses for them, or (if it had been imperatively required
to be spent decoratively) in laying out gardens and parks for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
them,&mdash;or buying noble works of art for their permanent
possession,&mdash;or, best of all, establishing frequent public
schools and libraries. Count what those lost millions would
have so accomplished for you! But you left the affair to
"supply and demand," and the British public had not brains
enough to "demand" land, or lodging, or books. It "demanded"
cast-iron cockades and zigzag cornices, and is
"supplied" with them, to its beatitude for evermore.</p>

<p>84. Now, the theft we first spoke of, by falsity of workmanship
or material, is, indeed, so far worse than these thefts
by dishonest acquisition, that there is no possible excuse for
it on the ground of self-deception; while many speculative
thefts are committed by persons who really mean to do no
harm, but think the system on the whole a fair one, and do
the best they can in it for themselves. But in the real fact
of the crime, when consciously committed, in the numbers
reached by its injury, in the degree of suffering it causes to
those whom it ruins, in the baseness of its calculated betrayal
of implicit trust, in the yet more perfect vileness of the
obtaining such trust by misrepresentation, only that it may
be betrayed, and in the impossibility that the crime should be
at all committed, except by persons of good position and large
knowledge of the world&mdash;what manner of theft is so wholly
unpardonable, so inhuman, so contrary to every law and instinct
which binds or animates society?</p>

<p>And then consider farther, how many of the carriages that
glitter in our streets are driven, and how many of the stately
houses that gleam among our English fields are inhabited,
by this kind of thief!</p>

<p>85. I happened to be reading this morning (29th March)
some portions of the Lent services, and I came to a pause over
the familiar words, "And with Him they crucified two
thieves." Have you ever considered (I speak to you now as
a professing Christian), why, in the accomplishment of the
"numbering among transgressors," the transgressors chosen
should have been especially thieves&mdash;not murderers, nor, as
far as we know, sinners by any gross violence? Do you observe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
how the sin of theft is again and again indicated as the
chiefly antagonistic one to the law of Christ? "This he said,
not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and
had the bag" (of Judas). And again, though Barabbas was
a leader of sedition, and a murderer besides,&mdash;(that the popular
election might be in all respects perfect)&mdash;yet St. John,
in curt and conclusive account of him, fastens again on the
theft. "Then cried they all again saying, Not this man, but
Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber." I believe myself
the reason to be that theft is indeed, in its subtle forms, the
most complete and excuseless of human crimes. Sins of violence
usually are committed under sudden or oppressive temptation:
they may be the madness of moments; or they may be
apparently the only means of extrication from calamity. In
other cases, they are the diseased acts or habits of lower and
brutified natures.<a name="FNanchor_A_10" id="FNanchor_A_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_10" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
But theft involving deliberative intellect,
and absence of passion, is the purest type of wilful iniquity,
in persons capable of doing right. Which being so, it seems
to be fast becoming the practice of modern society to crucify
its Christ indeed, as willingly as ever, in the persons of His
poor; but by no means now to crucify its thieves beside
Him! It elevates its thieves after another fashion; sets them
upon a hill, that their light may shine before men and that
all may see their good works, and glorify their Father, in&mdash;the
Opposite of Heaven.</p>

<p>86. I think your trade parliament will have to put an end
to this kind of business somehow! But it cannot be done by
laws merely, where the interests and circumstances are so
extended and complex. Nay, even as regards lower and more
defined crimes, the assigned punishment is not to be thought
of as a preventive means; but only as the seal of opinion
set by society on the fact. Crime cannot be hindered by punishment;
it will always find some shape and outlet, unpunishable
or unclosed. Crime can only be truly hindered by letting
no man grow up a criminal&mdash;by taking away the <i>will</i> to commit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
sin; not by mere punishment of its commission. Crime,
small and great, can only be truly stayed by education&mdash;not
the education of the intellect only, which is, on some men,
wasted, and for others mischievous; but education of the
heart, which is alike good and necessary for all. So, on this
matter, I will try in my next letter to say one or two things
of which the silence has kept my own heart heavy this many a
day.</p>

<p class="date"><i>March 30th, 1867.</i></p>

<p>87. Thank you for sending me the pamphlet containing
the account of the meeting of clergy and workmen, and of the
reasonings which there took place. I cannot promise you that
I shall read much of them, for the question to my mind most
requiring discussion and explanation is not, why workmen
don't go to church, but&mdash;why other people do. However,
this I know, that if among our many spiritual teachers, there
are indeed any who heartily and literally believe that the
wisdom they have to teach "is more precious than rubies, and
all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto
her," and if, so believing, they will further dare to affront
their congregations by the assertion; and plainly tell them
they are not to hunt for rubies or gold any more, at their
peril, till they have gained that which cannot be gotten for
gold, nor silver weighed for the price thereof,&mdash;such believers,
so preaching, and refusing to preach otherwise till
they are in that attended to, will never want congregations,
both of working men, and every other kind of men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
88. Did you ever hear of anything else so ill-named as the
phantom called the "Philosopher's Stone"? A talisman that
shall turn base metal into precious metal, nature acknowledges
not; nor would any but fools seek after it. But a talisman to
turn base souls into noble souls, nature has given us! and that
is a "Philosopher's Stone" indeed, but it is a stone which
the builders refuse.</p>

<p>89. If there were two valleys in California or Australia,
with two different kinds of gravel in the bottom of them; and
in the one stream bed you could dig up, occasionally and by
good fortune, nuggets of gold; and in the other stream bed,
certainly and without hazard, you could dig up little caskets,
containing talismans which gave length of days and peace;
and alabaster vases of precious balms, which were better than
the Arabian Dervish's ointment, and made not only the eyes
to see, but the mind to know, whatever it would&mdash;I wonder
in which of the stream beds there would be most diggers?</p>

<p>90. "Time is money"&mdash;so say your practised merchants
and economists. None of them, however, I fancy, as they
draw towards death, find that the reverse is true, and that
"money is time"? Perhaps it might be better for them, in
the end, if they did not turn so much of their time into money,
lest, perchance, they also turn Eternity into it! There are
other things, however, which in the same sense are money,
or can be changed into it, as well as time. Health is money,
wit is money, knowledge is money; and all your health, and
wit, and knowledge may be changed for gold; and the happy
goal so reached, of a sick, insane, and blind, auriferous old
age; but the gold cannot be changed in its turn back into
health and wit.</p>

<p>91. "Time is money;" the words tingle in my ears so that
I can't go on writing. Is it nothing better, then? If we
could thoroughly understand that time was&mdash;<i>itself</i>,&mdash;would it
not be more to the purpose? A thing of which loss or gain
was absolute loss, and perfect gain. And that it was expedient
also to buy health and knowledge with money, if so
purchasable; but not to buy money with <i>them</i>?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
And purchasable they are at the beginning of life, though
not at its close. Purchasable, always, for others, if not for
ourselves. You can buy, and cheaply, life, endless life, according
to your Christian's creed&mdash;(there's a bargain for
you!) but&mdash;long years of knowledge, and peace, and power,
and happiness of love&mdash;these assuredly and irrespectively of
any creed or question,&mdash;for all those desolate and haggard
children about your streets.</p>

<p>92. "That is not political economy, however." Pardon
me; the all-comfortable saying, "What he layeth out, it shall
be paid him again," is quite literally true in matters of
education; no money seed can be sown with so sure and large
return at harvest-time as that; only of this money-seed, more
than of flesh-seed, it is utterly true, "That which thou sowest
is not quickened except it <i>die</i>." You must forget your
money, and every other material interest, and educate for
education's sake only! or the very good you try to bestow
will become venomous, and that and your money will be lost
together.</p>

<p>93. And this has been the real cause of failure in our
efforts for education hitherto&mdash;whether from above or below.
There is no honest desire for the thing itself. The cry for
it among the lower orders is because they think that, when
once they have got it, they must become upper orders. There
is a strange notion in the mob's mind now-a-days (including
all our popular economists and educators, as we most justly
may, under that brief term "mob"), that <i>everybody</i> can be
uppermost; or at least, that a state of general scramble, in
which everybody in his turn should come to the top, is a
proper Utopian constitution; and that, once give every lad a
good education, and he cannot but come to ride in his carriage
(the methods of supply of coachmen and footmen not
being contemplated). And very sternly I say to you&mdash;and
say from sure knowledge&mdash;that a man had better not know
how to read and write, than receive education on such terms.</p>

<p>94. The first condition under which it can be given usefully
is, that it should be clearly understood to be no means
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of getting on in the world, but a means of staying pleasantly in your
place there. And the first elements of State education should be
calculated equally for the advantage of every order of person
composing the State. From the lowest to the highest class, every child
born in this island should be required by law to receive these general
elements of human discipline, and to be baptized&mdash;not with a drop
of water on its forehead&mdash;but in the cloud and sea of heavenly
wisdom and of earthly power.</p>

<p>And the elements of this general State education should be briefly
these:</p>

<p>95. First&mdash;The body must be made as beautiful and perfect in its
youth as it can be, wholly irrespective of ulterior purpose. If you
mean afterwards to set the creature to business which will degrade its
body and shorten its life, first, I should say, simply,&mdash;you had
better let such business alone;&mdash;but if you must have it done,
somehow, yet let the living creature, whom you mean to kill, get the
full strength of its body first, and taste the joy, and bear the
beauty of youth. After that, poison it, if you will. Economically, the
arrangement is a wiser one, for it will take longer in the killing
than if you began with it younger; and you will get an excess of work
out of it which will more than pay for its training.</p>

<p>Therefore, first teach&mdash;as I have said in the preface to 'Unto
this Last'&mdash;"The Laws of Health, and exercises enjoined by them;"
and, to this end, your schools must be in fresh country, and amidst
fresh air, and have great extents of land attached to them in
permanent estate. Riding, running, all the honest, personal exercises
of offense and defense, and music, should be the primal heads of this
bodily education.</p>

<p>96. Next to these bodily accomplishments, the two great
mental graces should be taught, Reverence and Compassion:
not that these are in a literal sense to be "taught," for they
are innate in every well-born human creature, but they have
to be developed exactly as the strength of the body must be,
by deliberate and constant exercise. I never understood why
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Goethe (in the plan of education in 'Wilhelm Meister') says that
reverence is not innate, but must be taught from without; it seems to
me so fixedly a function of the human spirit, that if men can get
nothing else to reverence they will worship a fool, or a stone, or a
vegetable.<a name="FNanchor_A_12" id="FNanchor_A_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_12" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
But to teach reverence rightly is to attach it to the right persons
and things; first, by setting over your youth masters whom they cannot
but love and respect; next, by gathering for them, out of past
history, whatever has been most worthy in human deeds and human
passion; and leading them continually to dwell upon such instances,
making this the principal element of emotional excitement to them;
and, lastly, by letting them justly feel, as far as may be, the
smallness of their own powers and knowledge, as compared with the
attainments of others.</p>

<p>97. Compassion, on the other hand, is to be taught chiefly by making
it a point of honor, collaterally with courage, and in the same rank
(as indeed the complement and evidence of courage), so that, in the
code of unwritten school law, it shall be held as shameful to have
done a cruel thing as a cowardly one. All infliction of pain on weaker
creatures is to be stigmatized as unmanly crime; and every possible
opportunity taken to exercise the youths in offices of some practical
help, and to acquaint them with the realities of the distress which,
in the joyfulness of entering into life, it is so difficult, for those
who have not seen home suffering, to conceive.</p>

<p>98. Reverence, then, and compassion, we are to teach
primarily, and with these, as the bond and guardian of them,
truth of spirit and word, of thought and sight. Truth, earnest
and passionate, sought for like a treasure, and kept like
a crown.</p>

<p>This teaching of truth as a habit will be the chief work the
master has to do; and it will enter into all parts of education.
First, you must accustom the children to close accuracy of
statement; this both as a principle of honor, and as an accomplishment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of language, making them try always who shall speak truest, both as
regards the fact he has to relate or express (not concealing or
exaggerating), and as regards the precision of the words he expresses
it in, thus making truth (which, indeed, it is) the test of perfect
language, and giving the intensity of a moral purpose to the study and
art of words: then carrying this accuracy into all habits of thought
and observation also, so as always to <i>think</i> of things as they truly
are, and to see them as they truly are, as far as in us rests. And it
does rest much in our power, for all false thoughts and seeings come
mainly of our thinking of what we have no business with, and looking
for things we want to see, instead of things that ought to be seen.</p>

<p>99. "Do not talk but of what you know; do not think but
of what you have materials to think justly upon; and do not
look for things only that you like, when there are others to
be seen"&mdash;this is the lesson to be taught to our youth, and
inbred in them; and that mainly by our own example and
continence. Never teach a child anything of which you are
not yourself sure; and, above all, if you feel anxious to force
anything into its mind in tender years, that the virtue of
youth and early association may fasten it there, be sure it is
no lie which you thus sanctify. There is always more to be
taught of absolute, incontrovertible knowledge, open to its
capacity, than any child can learn; there is no need to teach
it anything doubtful. Better that it should be ignorant of
a thousand truths, than have consecrated in its heart a single
lie.</p>

<p>100. And for this, as well as for many other reasons, the
principal subjects of education, after history, ought to be
natural science and mathematics; but with respect to these
studies, your schools will require to be divided into three
groups: one for children who will probably have to live in
cities, one for those who will live in the country, and one
for those who will live at sea; the schools for these last, of
course, being always placed on the coast. And for children
whose life is to be in cities, the subjects of study should be,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
as far as their disposition will allow of it, mathematics and
the arts; for children who are to live in the country, natural
history of birds, insects, and plants, together with agriculture
taught practically; and for children who are to be seamen,
physical geography, astronomy, and the natural history of
sea-fish and sea-birds.</p>

<p>101. This, then, being the general course and material of
education for all children, observe farther, that in the preface
to 'Unto this Last' I said that every child, besides passing
through this course, was at school to learn "the calling by
which it was to live." And it may perhaps appear to you
that after, or even in the early stages of education such as
this above described, there are many callings which, however
much called to them, the children might not willingly determine
to learn or live by. "Probably," you may say, "after
they have learned to ride, and fence, and sing, and know
birds and flowers, it will be little to their liking to make
themselves into tailors, carpenters, shoemakers, blacksmiths,
and the like." And I cannot but agree with you as to the
exceeding probability of some such reluctance on their part,
which will be a very awkward state of things indeed, (since
we can by no means get on without tailoring and shoemaking,)
and one to be meditated upon very seriously in next
letter.</p>

<p>102. P.S.&mdash;Thank you for sending me your friend's letter
about Gustave Dor&eacute;; he is wrong, however, in thinking there
is any good in those illustrations of 'Elaine.' I had intended
to speak of them afterwards, for it is to my mind quite as
significant&mdash;almost as awful&mdash;a sign of what is going on in
the midst of us, that our great English poet should have
suffered his work to be thus contaminated, as that the lower
Evangelicals, never notable for sense in the arts, should have
got their Bibles dishonored. Those 'Elaine' illustrations are
just as impure as anything else that Dor&eacute; has done; but they
are also vapid, and without any one merit whatever in point
of art. The illustrations to the 'Contes Dr&ocirc;latiques' are
full of power and invention; but those to 'Elaine' are merely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and simply stupid; theatrical b&ecirc;tises, with the taint of the
charnel-house on them besides.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_11" id="Footnote_A_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_11"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
"Mercy," in its full sense, means delight in perceiving nobleness,
or in doing kindness. Compare &sect; 50.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_12" id="Footnote_A_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_12"><span class="label">[B]</span></a>
By steady preaching against it, one may quench reverence, and
bring insolence to its height; but the instinct cannot be wholly uprooted.</p></div>

<p class="subhead">THE RELATIONS OF EDUCATION TO POSITION IN LIFE.</p>


<p class="date"><i>April 3, 1867.</i></p>

<p>103. I am not quite sure that you will feel the awkwardness
of the dilemma I got into at the end of last letter, as much as
I do myself. You working men have been crowing and peacocking
at such a rate lately; and setting yourselves forth so
confidently for the cream of society, and the top of the world,
that perhaps you will not anticipate any of the difficulties
which suggest themselves to a thoroughbred Tory and Conservative,
like me. Perhaps you will expect a youth properly
educated&mdash;a good rider&mdash;musician&mdash;and well-grounded
scholar in natural philosophy, to think it a step of promotion
when he has to go and be made a tailor of, or a coalheaver?
If you do, I should very willingly admit that you might be
right, and go on to the farther development of my notions
without pausing at this stumbling-block, were it not that,
unluckily, all the wisest men whose sayings I ever heard or
read, agree in expressing (one way or another) just such
contempt for those useful occupations, as I dread on the part
of my foolishly refined scholars. Shakespeare and Chaucer,&mdash;Dante
and Virgil,&mdash;Horace and Pindar,&mdash;Homer, &AElig;schylus,
and Plato,&mdash;all the men of any age or country who
seem to have had Heaven's music on their lips, agree in their
scorn of mechanic life. And I imagine that the feeling of
prudent Englishmen, and sensible as well as sensitive Englishwomen,
on reading my last letter, would mostly be&mdash;"Is
the man mad, or laughing at us, to propose educating
the working classes this way? He could not, if his wild
scheme were possible, find a better method of making them
acutely wretched."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
104. It may be so, my sensible and polite friends; and I am heartily
willing, as well as curious, to hear you develop your own scheme of
operative education, so only that it be universal, orderly, and
careful. I do not say that I shall be prepared to advocate my
athletics and philosophies instead. Only, observe what you admit, or
imply, in bringing forward your possibly wiser system. You imply that
a certain portion of mankind must be employed in degrading work; and
that, to fit them for this work, it is necessary to limit their
knowledge, their active powers, and their enjoyments, from childhood
upwards, so that they may not be able to conceive of any state better
than the one they were born in, nor possess any knowledge or
acquirements inconsistent with the coarseness, or disturbing the
monotony, of their vulgar occupation. And by their labor in this
contracted state of mind, we superior beings are to be maintained; and
always to be curtseyed to by the properly ignorant little girls, and
capped by the properly ignorant little boys, whenever we pass by.</p>

<p>105. Mind, I do not say that this is <i>not</i> the right state of
things. Only, if it be, you need not be so over-particular about
the slave-trade, it seems to me. What is the use of arguing so
pertinaciously that a black's skull will hold as much as a white's,
when you are declaring in the same breath that a white's skull must
not hold as much as it can, or it will be the worse for him? It does
not appear to me at all a profound state of slavery to be whipped into
doing a piece of low work that I don't like; but it is a very profound
state of slavery to be kept, myself, low in the forehead, that I may
not dislike low work.</p>

<p>106. You see, my friend, the dilemma is really an awkward
one, whichever way you look at it. But, what is still
worse, I am not puzzled only, at this part of my scheme, about
the boys I shall have to make <i>workmen</i> of; I am just
as much puzzled about the boys I shall have to make <i>nothing</i>
of! Grant, that by hook or crook, by reason or rattan, I
persuade a certain number of the roughest ones into some
serviceable business, and get coats and shoes made for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
rest,&mdash;what is the business of "the rest" to be? Naturally,
according to the existing state of things, one supposes they are to
belong to some of the gentlemanly professions; to be soldiers,
lawyers, doctors, or clergymen. But alas, I shall not want any
soldiers of special skill or pugnacity. <i>All</i> my boys will be
soldiers. So far from wanting any lawyers, of the kind that live by
talking, I shall have the strongest possible objection to their
appearance in the country. For doctors, I shall always entertain a
profound respect; but when I get my athletic education fairly
established, of what help to them will my respect be? They will all
starve! And for clergymen, it is true, I shall have a large number of
episcopates&mdash;one over every hundred families&mdash;(and many
positions of civil authority also, for civil officers, above them and
below), but all these places will involve much hard work, and be
anything but covetable; while, of clergymen's usual work, admonition,
theological demonstration, and the like, I shall want very little done
indeed, and that little done for nothing! for I will allow no man to
admonish anybody, until he has previously earned his own dinner by
more productive work than admonition.</p>

<p>Well, I wish, my friend, you would write me a word or two in answer to
this, telling me your own ideas as to the proper issue out of these
difficulties. I should like to know what you think, and what you
suppose others will think, before I tell you my own notions about the
matter.</p>

<p class="subhead">THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF SERVILE EMPLOYMENTS. THE POSSIBLE
PRACTICE AND EXHIBITION OF SINCERE HUMILITY BY RELIGIOUS PERSONS.</p>


<p class="date"><i>April 7, 1867.</i></p>

<p>107. I have been waiting these three days to know what
you would say to my last questions; and now you send me
two pamphlets of Combe's to read! I never read anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in spring-time (except the Ai, Ai, on the "sanguine flower inscribed
with woe"); and, besides, if, as I gather from your letter, Combe
thinks that among well-educated boys there would be a percentage
constitutionally inclined to be cobblers, or looking forward with
unction to establishment in the oil and tallow line, or fretting
themselves for a flunkey's uniform, nothing that he could say would
make me agree with him. I know, as well as he does, the unconquerable
differences in the clay of the human creature: and I know that, in the
outset, whatever system of education you adopted, a large number of
children could be made nothing of, and would necessarily fall out of
the ranks, and supply candidates enough for degradation to common
mechanical business: but this enormous difference in bodily and mental
capacity has been mainly brought about by difference in occupation,
and by direct maltreatment; and in a few generations, if the poor were
cared for, their marriages looked after, and sanitary law enforced, a
beautiful type of face and form, and a high intelligence, would become
all but universal, in a climate like this of England. Even as it is,
the marvel is always to me, how the race resists, at least in its
childhood, influences of ill-regulated birth, poisoned food, poisoned
air, and soul neglect. I often see faces of children, as I walk
through the black district of St. Giles's (lying, as it does, just
between my own house and the British Museum), which, through all their
pale and corrupt misery, recall the old "Non Angli," and recall it,
not by their beauty, but by their sweetness of expression, even though
signed already with trace and cloud of the coming life,&mdash;a life
so bitter that it would make the curse of the 137th Psalm true upon
our modern Babylon, though we were to read it thus, "Happy shall <i>thy
children</i> be, if one taketh and dasheth them against the stones."</p>

<p>108. Yes, very solemnly I repeat to you that in those
worst treated children of the English race, I yet see the
making of gentlemen and gentlewomen&mdash;not the making of
dog-stealers and gin-drinkers, such as their parents were; and
the child of the average English tradesman or peasant, even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
at this day, well schooled, will show no innate disposition
such as must fetter him forever to the clod or the counter.
You say that many a boy runs away, or would run away if
he could, from good positions to go to sea. Of course he
does. I never said I should have any difficulty in finding
sailors, but I shall in finding fishmongers. I am at no loss
for gardeners either, but what am I to do for greengrocers?</p>

<p>109. The fact is, a great number of quite necessary employments are,
in the accuratest sense, "Servile;" that is, they sink a man to the
condition of a serf, or unthinking worker, the proper state of an
animal, but more or less unworthy of men; nay, unholy in some sense,
so that a day is made "holy" by the fact of its being commanded, "Thou
shalt do no <i>servile</i> work therein." And yet, if undertaken in a
certain spirit, such work might be the holiest of all. If there were
but a thread or two of sound fiber here and there left in our modern
religion, so that the stuff of it would bear a real strain, one might
address our two opposite groups of evangelicals and ritualists
somewhat after this fashion:&mdash;"Good friends, these differences of
opinion between you cannot but be painful to your Christian charity,
and they are unseemly to us, the profane; and prevent us from learning
from you what, perhaps, we ought. But, as we read your Book, we, for
our part, gather from it that you might, without danger to your own
souls, set an undivided example to us, for the benefit of ours. You,
both of you, as far as we understand, agree in the necessity of
humility to the perfection of your character. We often hear you, of
Calvinistic persuasion, speaking of yourselves as 'sinful dust and
ashes,'&mdash;would it then be inconsistent with your feelings to make
yourselves into 'serviceable' dust and ashes? We observe that of late
many of our roads have been hardened and mended with cinders; now, if,
in a higher sense, you could allow us to mend the roads of the world with
<i>you</i> a little, it would be a great proof to us of your sincerity.
Suppose, only for a little while, in the present difficulty and distress,
you were to make it a test of conversion that a man should regularly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
give Zaccheus's portion, half his goods, to the poor, and at once
adopt some disagreeable and despised, but thoroughly useful, trade?
You cannot think that this would finally be to your disadvantage; you
doubtless believe the texts, 'He that giveth to the poor lendeth to
the Lord,' and 'He that would be chief among you, let him be your
servant.' The more you parted with, and the lower you stooped, the
greater would be your final reward, and final exaltation. You profess
to despise human learning and worldly riches; leave both of these to
<i>us</i>; undertake for us the illiterate and ill-paid employments which
must deprive you of the privileges of society and the pleasures of
luxury. You cannot possibly preach your faith so forcibly to the world
by any quantity of the finest words, as by a few such simple and
painful acts; and over your counters, in honest retail business, you
might preach a gospel that would sound in more ears than any that was
ever proclaimed over pulpit cushions or tabernacle rails. And,
whatever may be your gifts of utterance, you cannot but feel (studying
St. Paul's Epistles as carefully as you do) that you might more easily
and modestly emulate the practical teaching of the silent Apostle of
the Gentiles than the speech or writing of his companion. Amidst the
present discomforts of your brethren you may surely, with greater
prospect of good to them, seek the title of Sons of Consolation, than
of Sons of Thunder, and be satisfied with Barnabas's confession of
faith, (if you can reach no farther,) who, 'having land, sold it, and
brought the money and laid it at the Apostles' feet.'</p>

<p>110. "To you, on the other hand, gentlemen of the embroidered robe,
who neither despise learning nor the arts, we know that sacrifices
such as these would be truly painful, and might at first appear
inexpedient. But the doctrine of self-mortification is not a new one
to you; and we should be sorry to think&mdash;we would not, indeed,
for a moment dishonor you by thinking&mdash;that these melodious
chants, and prismatic brightnesses of vitreous pictures, and floral
graces of deep-wrought stone, were in any wise intended for your own poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
pleasures, whatever profane attraction they may exercise on more
fleshly-minded persons. And as you have certainly received no definite
order for the painting, carving, or lighting up of churches, while the
temple of the body of so many poor living Christians is so pale, so
mis-shapen, and so ill-lighted; but have, on the contrary, received
very definite orders for the feeding and clothing of such sad
humanity, we may surely ask you, not unreasonably, to humiliate
yourselves in the most complete way&mdash;not with a voluntary, but a
sternly <i>in</i>voluntary humility&mdash;not with a show of wisdom in
will-worship, but with practical wisdom, in all honor, to the
satisfying of the flesh; and to associate yourselves in monasteries
and convents for the better practice of useful and humble trades. Do
not burn any more candles, but mould some; do not paint any more
windows, but mend a few where the wind comes in, in winter time, with
substantial clear glass and putty. Do not vault any more high roofs,
but thatch some low ones; and embroider rather on backs which are
turned to the cold, than only on those which are turned to
congregations. And you will have your reward afterwards, and attain,
with all your flocks thus tended, to a place where you may have as
much gold, and painted glass, and singing, as you like."</p>

<p>Thus much, it seems to me, one might say with some hope of acceptance,
to any very earnest member of either of our two great religious
parties, if, as I say, their faith could stand a strain. I have not,
however, based any of my imaginary political arrangements on the
probability of its doing so; and I trust only to such general good
nature and willingness to help each other, as I presume may be found
among men of the world; to whom I should have to make quite another
sort of speech, which I will endeavor to set down the heads of, for
you, in next letter.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XIX" id="LETTER_XIX"></a>LETTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="subhead">THE GENERAL PRESSURE OF EXCESSIVE AND IMPROPER WORK,
IN ENGLISH LIFE.</p>


<p class="date"><i>April 10, 1867.</i></p>

<p>111. I cannot go on to-day with the part of my subject I
had proposed, for I was disturbed by receiving a letter last
night, which I herewith enclose to you, and of which I wish
you to print, here following, the parts I have not underlined&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="date">1, Phene Street, Chelsea, April 8, 1867.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear R</span>&mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;</p>

<p>It is long since you have heard of me, and now I ask your patience
with me for a little. I have but just returned from the funeral of my
dear, dear friend &mdash;&mdash;, the first artist friend I made in London&mdash;a
loved and prized one. For years past he had lived in the very humblest
way, fighting his battle of life against mean appreciation of his
talents, the wants of a rising family, and frequent attacks of illness,
crippling him for months at a time, the wolf at the door meanwhile.</p>

<p>But about two years since his prospects brightened * * * and he had
but a few weeks since ventured on removal to a larger house. His
eldest boy of seventeen years, a very intelligent youth, so strongly
desired to be a civil engineer that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, not being able to pay the
large premium required for his apprenticeship, had been made very
glad by the consent of Mr. Penn, of Millwall, to receive him without a
premium after the boy should have spent some time at King's College
in the study of mechanics. The rest is a sad story. About a fortnight
ago Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was taken ill, and died last week, the doctors say, of
sheer physical exhaustion, not thirty-nine years old, leaving eight
young children, and his poor widow expecting her confinement, and
so weak and ill as to be incapable of effort. This youth is the eldest,
and the other children range downwards to a babe of eighteen
months. There is not one who knew him, I believe, that will not give
cheerfully, to their ability, for his widow and children; but such aid
will go but a little way in this painful case; and it would be a real
boon to this poor widow if some of her children could be got into an
Orphan Asylum. * * *</p>

<p>If you are able to do anything I would send particulars of the age
and sex of the children.</p>

<p class="regards">I remain, dear Sir, ever obediently yours,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Fred. J. Shields.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
P.S.&mdash;I ought to say that poor &mdash;&mdash; has been quite unable to save,
with his large family; and that they would be utterly destitute now,
but for the kindness of some with whom he was professionally connected.</p></div>

<p>112. Now this case, of which you see the entire authenticity,
is, out of the many of which I hear continually, a
<i>notably</i> sad one only in so far as the artist in question has
died of distress while he was catering for the public amusement.
Hardly a week now passes without some such misery
coming to my knowledge; and the quantity of pain, and
anxiety of daily effort, through the best part of life, ending
all at last in utter grief, which the lower middle classes
in England are now suffering, is so great that I feel constantly
as if I were living in one great churchyard, with
people all round me clinging feebly to the edges of the open
graves, and calling for help, as they fall back into them, out
of sight.</p>

<p>113. Now I want you to observe here, in a definite case,
the working of your beautiful modern political economy of
"supply and demand." Here is a man who could have
"supplied" you with good and entertaining art,&mdash;say for
fifty good years,&mdash;if you had paid him enough for his day's
work to find him and his children peacefully in bread. But
you like having your prints as cheap as possible&mdash;you triumph
in the little that your laugh costs&mdash;you take all you can get
from the man, give the least you can give to him,&mdash;and you
accordingly kill him at thirty-nine; and thereafter have his
children to take care of, or to kill also, whichever you
choose; but, now, observe, you must take care of <i>them</i> for
nothing, or not at all; and what you might have had good
value for, if you had given it when it would have cheered
the father's heart, you now can have no return for at all, to
yourselves; and what you give to the orphans, if it does not
degrade them, at least afflicts, coming, not through their
father's hand, its honest earnings, but from strangers.</p>

<p>Observe, farther, whatever help the orphans may receive,
will not be from the public at all. It will not be from those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
who profited by their father's labors; it will be chiefly from
his fellow-laborers; or from persons whose money would have
been beneficially spent in other directions, from whence it is
drawn away to this need, which ought never to have occurred,&mdash;while
those who waste their money without doing any service
to the public will never contribute one farthing to this
distress.</p>

<p>114. Now it is this double fault in the help&mdash;that it comes
too late, and that the burden of it falls wholly on those who
ought least to be charged with it&mdash;which would be corrected
by that institution of overseers of which I spoke to you in the
twelfth of these letters, saying, you remember, that they were
to have farther legal powers, which I did not then specify,
but which would belong to them chiefly in the capacity of
public almoners, or help-givers, aided by their deacons, the
reception of such help, in time of true need, being not held
disgraceful, but honorable; since the fact of its reception
would be so entirely public that no impostor or idle person
could ever obtain it surreptitiously.</p>

<p>115. (11th April.) I was interrupted yesterday, and I am
glad of it, for here happens just an instance of the way in
which the unjust distribution of the burden of charity is
reflected on general interests; I cannot help what taint of
ungracefulness you or other readers of these letters may feel
that I incur, in speaking, in this instance, of myself. If I
could speak with the same accurate knowledge of any one
else, most gladly I would; but I also think it right that,
whether people accuse me of boasting or not, they should know
that I practise what I preach. I had not intended to say
what I now shall, but the coming of this letter last night just
turns the balance of the decision with me. I enclose it with
the other; you see it is one from my bookseller, Mr. Quaritch,
offering me Fischer's work on the <i>Flora of Java</i>, and Latour's
on <i>Indian Orchidace&aelig;</i>, bound together, for twenty guineas.
Now, I am writing a book on botany just now, for young
people, chiefly on wild flowers, and I want these two books
very much; but I simply cannot afford to buy them, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
I sent my last spare twenty guineas to Mr. Shields yesterday
for this widow. And though you may think it not the affair
of the public that I have not this book on Indian flowers, it
is their affair finally, that what I write for them should be
founded on as broad knowledge as possible; whatever value
my own book may or may not have, it will just be in a given
degree worth <i>less</i> to them, because of my want of this knowledge.</p>

<p>116. So again&mdash;for having begun to speak of myself I
will do so yet more frankly&mdash;I suppose that when people see
my name down for a hundred pounds to the Cruikshank
Memorial, and for another hundred to the Eyre Defense
Fund, they think only that I have more money than I know
what to do with. Well, the giving of those subscriptions
simply decides the question whether or no I shall be able to
afford a journey to Switzerland this year, in the negative;
and I wanted to go, not only for health's sake, but to examine
the junctions of the molasse sandstones and nagelfluh with the
Alpine limestone, in order to complete some notes I meant to
publish next spring on the geology of the great northern
Swiss valley; notes which must now lie by me at least for
another year; and I believe this delay (though I say it) will
be really something of a loss to the traveling public, for the
little essay was intended to explain to them, in a familiar
way, the real wonderfulness of their favorite mountain, the
Righi; and to give them some amusement in trying to find out
where the many-colored pebbles of it had come from. But it
is more important that I should, with some stoutness, assert
my respect for the genius and earnest patriotism of Cruikshank,
and my much more than disrespect for the Jamaica
Committee, than that I should see the Alps this year, or get
my essay finished next spring; but I tell you the fact, because
I want you to feel how, in thus leaving their men of worth
to be assisted or defended only by those who deeply care for
them, the public more or less cripple, to their own ultimate
disadvantage, just the people who could serve them in other
ways; while the speculators and money-seekers, who are only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
making their profit out of the said public, of course take no
part in the help of anybody. And even if the willing bearers
could sustain the burden anywise adequately, none of us would
complain; but I am certain there is no man, whatever his
fortune, who is now engaged in any earnest offices of kindness
to these sufferers, especially of the middle class, among his
acquaintance, who will not bear me witness that for one we
can relieve, we must leave three to perish. I have left three,
myself, in the first three months of this year. One was the
artist Paul Gray, for whom an appeal was made to me for
funds to assist him in going abroad out of the bitter English
winter. I had not the means by me, and he died a week
afterwards. Another case was that of a widow whose husband
had committed suicide, for whom application was made
to me at the same time; and the third was a personal friend,
to whom I refused a sum which he said would have saved
him from bankruptcy. I believe six times as much would
not have saved him; however, I refused, and he is ruined.</p>

<p>117. And observe, also, it is not the mere crippling of my
means that I regret. It is the crippling of my temper, and
waste of my time. The knowledge of all this distress, even
when I can assist it,&mdash;much more when I cannot,&mdash;and the
various thoughts of what I can and cannot, or ought and
ought not, to do, are a far greater burden to me than the
mere loss of the money. It is peremptorily not my business&mdash;it
is not my gift, bodily or mentally, to look after other
people's sorrow. I have enough of my own; and even if I
had not, the sight of pain is not good for me. I don't want
to be a bishop. In a most literal and sincere sense, "<i>nolo
episcopari</i>." I don't want to be an almoner, nor a counselor,
nor a Member of Parliament, nor a voter for Members of
Parliament. (What would Mr. Holyoake say to me if he
knew that I have never voted for anybody in my life, and
never mean to do so!) I am essentially a painter and a leaf
dissector; and my powers of thought are all purely mathematical,
seizing ultimate principles only&mdash;never accidents; a
line is always, to me, length without breadth; it is not a cable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
or a crowbar; and though I can almost infallibly reason out
the final law of anything, if within reach of my industry, I
neither care for, nor can trace, the minor exigencies of its
daily appliance. So, in every way, I like a quiet life; and I
don't like seeing people cry, or die; and should rejoice,
more than I can tell you, in giving up the full half of my
fortune for the poor, provided I knew that the public would
make Lord Overstone also give the half of his, and other
people who were independent give the half of theirs; and
then set men who were really fit for such office to administer
the fund, and answer to us for nobody's perishing innocently;
and so leave us all to do what we chose with the rest, and
with our days, in peace.</p>

<p>Thus far of the public's fault in the matter. Next, I have
a word or two to say of the sufferers' own fault&mdash;for much
as I pity them, I conceive that none of them <i>do</i> perish
altogether innocently. But this must be for next letter.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="LETTER_XX" id="LETTER_XX"></a>LETTER XX.</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF IMPROVIDENCE IN MARRIAGE IN THE MIDDLE CLASSES;
AND OF THE ADVISABLE RESTRICTIONS OF IT.</p>


<p class="date"><i>April 12, 1867.</i></p>

<p>118. It is quite as well, whatever irregularity it may
introduce in the arrangement of the general subject, that
yonder sad letter warped me away from the broad inquiry,
to this speciality, respecting the present distress of the middle
classes. For the immediate cause of that distress, in their
own imprudence, of which I have to speak to you to-day, is
only to be finally vanquished by strict laws, which, though
they have been many a year in my mind, I was glad to have
a quiet hour of sunshine for the thinking over again, this
morning. Sunshine which happily rose cloudless; and
allowed me to meditate my tyrannies before breakfast, under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the just opened blossoms of my orchard, and assisted by much
melodious advice from the birds; who (my gardener having
positive orders never to trouble any of them in anything, or
object to their eating even my best peas if they like their
flavor) rather now get <i>into</i> my way, than out of it, when
they see me about the walks; and take me into most of their
counsels in nest-building.</p>

<p>119. The letter from Mr. Shields, which interrupted us,
reached me, as you see, on the evening of the 9th instant.
On the morning of the 10th, I received another, which I herewith
forward to you, for verification. It is&mdash;characteristically
enough&mdash;dateless, so you must take the time of its arrival
on my word. And substituting M. N. for the name of the
boy referred to, and withholding only the address and name
of the writer, you see that it may be printed word for word&mdash;as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>May I beg for the favor of your presentation to Christ's Hospital
for my youngest son, M. N.? I have nine children, and no means to
educate them. I ventured to address you, believing that my husband's
name is not unknown to you as an artist.</p>

<p class="regards">Believe me to remain faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="smcap">* * *</span></p>
</div>

<p>120. Now this letter is only a typical example of the
entire class of those which, being a governor of Christ's
Hospital, I receive, in common with all the other governors,
at the rate of about three a day, for a month or six weeks
from the date of our names appearing in the printed list of
the governors who have presentations for the current year.
Having been a governor now some twenty-five years, I have
documentary evidence enough to found some general statistics
upon; from which there have resulted two impressions on my
mind, which I wish here specially to note to you, and I do
not doubt but that all the other governors, if you could ask
them, would at once confirm what I say. My first impression
is, a heavy and sorrowful sense of the general feebleness of
intellect of that portion of the British public which stands in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
need of presentations to Christ's Hospital. This feebleness
of intellect is mainly shown in the nearly total unconsciousness
of the writers that anybody else may want a presentation,
besides themselves. With the exception here and there of a
soldier's or a sailor's widow, hardly one of them seems to have
perceived the existence of any distress in the world but their
own: none know what they are asking for, or imagine, unless
as a remote contingency, the possibility of its having been
promised at a prior date. The second most distinct impression
on my mind, is that the portion of the British public
which is in need of presentations to Christ's Hospital considers
it a merit to have large families, with or without the
means of supporting them!</p>

<p>121. Now it happened also (and remember, all this is
strictly true, nor in the slightest particular represented otherwise
than as it chanced; though the said chance brought thus
together exactly the evidence I wanted for my letter to you)&mdash;it
happened, I say, that on this same morning of the 10th
April, I became accidentally acquainted with a case of quite
a different kind: that of a noble girl, who, engaged at sixteen,
and having received several advantageous offers since, has
remained for ten years faithful to her equally faithful lover;
while, their circumstances rendering it, as they rightly considered,
unjustifiable in them to think of marriage, each of
them simply and happily, aided and cheered by the other's
love, discharged the duties of their own separate positions
in life.</p>

<p>122. In the nature of things, instances of this kind of noble
life remain more or less concealed, (while imprudence and
error proclaim themselves by misfortune,) but they are assuredly
not unfrequent in our English homes. Let us next
observe the political and national result of these arrangements.
You leave your marriages to be settled by "supply
and demand," instead of wholesome law. And thus, among
your youths and maidens, the improvident, incontinent, selfish,
and foolish ones marry, whether you will or not; and
beget families of children necessarily inheritors in a great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
degree of these parental dispositions; and for whom, supposing
they had the best dispositions in the world, you have thus
provided, by way of educators, the foolishest fathers and
mothers you could find; (the only rational sentence in their
letters, usually, is the invariable one, in which they declare
themselves "incapable of providing for their children's education").
On the other hand, whosoever is wise, patient,
unselfish, and pure among your youth, you keep maid or
bachelor; wasting their best days of natural life in painful
sacrifice, forbidding them their best help and best reward,
and carefully excluding their prudence and tenderness from
any offices of parental duty.</p>

<p>Is not this a beatific and beautifully sagacious system for
a Celestial Empire, such as that of these British Isles?</p>

<p>123. I will not here enter into any statement of the
physical laws which it is the province of our physicians to
explain; and which are indeed at last so far beginning to be
understood, that there is hope of the nation's giving some of
the attention to the conditions affecting the race of man, which
it has hitherto bestowed only on those which may better its
races of cattle.</p>

<p>It is enough, I think, to say here that the beginning of all
sanitary and moral law is in the regulation of marriage, and
that, ugly and fatal as is every form and agency of license,
no licentiousness is so mortal as licentiousness in marriage.</p>

<p>124. Briefly, then, and in main points, subject in minor
ones to such modifications in detail as local circumstances and
characters would render expedient, those following are laws
such as a prudent nation would institute respecting its marriages.
Permission to marry should be the reward held in
sight of its youth during the entire latter part of the course
of their education; and it should be granted as the national
attestation that the first portion of their lives had been rightly
fulfilled. It should not be attainable without earnest and
consistent effort, though put within the reach of all who were
willing to make such effort; and the granting of it should be
a public testimony to the fact, that the youth or maid to whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
it was given had lived, within their proper sphere, a modest
and virtuous life, and had attained such skill in their proper
handicraft, and in arts of household economy, as might give
well-founded expectations of their being able honorably to
maintain and teach their children.</p>

<p>125. No girl should receive her permission to marry before
her seventeenth birthday, nor any youth before his twenty-first;
and it should be a point of somewhat distinguished
honor with both sexes to gain their permission of marriage
in the eighteenth and twenty-second years; and a recognized
disgrace not to have gained it at least before the close of their
twenty-first and twenty-fourth. I do not mean that they
should in any wise hasten actual marriage; but only that they
should hold it a point of honor to have the right to marry.
In every year there should be two festivals, one on the first
of May, and one at the feast of harvest home in each district,
at which festivals their permissions to marry should be given
publicly to the maidens and youths who had won them in that
half-year; and they should be crowned, the maids by the old
French title of Rosi&egrave;res, and the youths, perhaps by some
name rightly derived from one supposed signification of the
word "bachelor," "laurel fruit," and so led in joyful procession,
with music and singing, through the city street or
village lane, and the day ended with feasting of the poor.</p>

<p>126. And every bachelor and rosi&egrave;re should be entitled to
claim, if they needed it, according to their position in life, a
fixed income from the State, for seven years from the day of
their marriage, for the setting up of their homes; and, however
rich they might be by inheritance, their income should
not be permitted to exceed a given sum, proportioned to their
rank, for the seven years following that in which they had
obtained their permission to marry, but should accumulate
in the trust of the State until that seventh year, in which they
should be put (on certain conditions) finally in possession of
their property; and the men, thus necessarily not before
their twenty-eighth, nor usually later than their thirty-first
year, become eligible to offices of State.  So that the rich and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
poor should not be sharply separated in the beginning of the
war of life; but the one supported against the first stress of it
long enough to enable them, by proper forethought and
economy, to secure their footing; and the other trained somewhat
in the use of moderate means, before they were permitted
to have the command of abundant ones. And of the
sources from which these State incomes for the married poor
should be supplied, or of the treatment of those of our youth
whose conduct rendered it advisable to refuse them permission
to marry, I defer what I have to say till we come to the
general subjects of taxation and criminal discipline; leaving
the proposals made in this letter to bear, for the present, whatever
aspect of mere romance and unrealizable vision they
probably may, and to most readers, such as they assuredly
will. Nor shall I make the slightest effort to redeem them
from these imputations; for though there is nothing in all
their purport which would not be approved, as in the deepest
sense "practical"&mdash;by the Spirit of Paradise&mdash;</p>

<p>and though I know that national justice in conduct, and

I confess with much <i>dis</i>peace of heart, that both justice and

<p class="subhead">OF THE DIGNITY OF THE FOUR FINE ARTS; AND OF THE
PROPER SYSTEM OF RETAIL TRADE.</p>


<p class="date"><i>April 15, 1867.</i></p>

<p>127. I return now to the part of the subject at which I
was interrupted&mdash;the inquiry as to the proper means of finding
persons willing to maintain themselves and others by
degrading occupations.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
That, on the whole, simply manual occupations <i>are</i> degrading,
I suppose I may assume you to admit; at all events, the fact is
so, and I suppose few general readers will have any doubt of
it.<a name="FNanchor_A_13" id="FNanchor_A_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_13" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Granting this, it follows as a direct consequence that it is
the duty of all persons in higher stations of life, by every
means in their power to diminish their demand for work of
such kind, <i>and to live with as little aid from the lower
trades</i>, as they can possibly contrive.</p>

<p>128. I suppose you see that this conclusion is not a little
at variance with received notions on political economy? It
is popularly supposed that it benefits a nation to invent a
want. But the fact is, that the true benefit is in extinguishing
a want&mdash;in living with as few wants as possible.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you the contempt I feel for the common writers
on political economy, in their stupefied missing of this first
principle of all human economy&mdash;individual or political&mdash;to
live, namely, with as few wants as possible, and to waste
nothing of what is given you to supply them.</p>

<p>129. This ought to be the first lesson of every rich man's political
code. "Sir," his tutor should early say to him, "you are so placed in
society,&mdash;it may be for your misfortune, it <i>must</i> be for
your trial&mdash;that you are likely to be maintained all your life
by the labor of other men. You will have to make shoes for nobody,
but some one will have to make a great many for you. You will have
to dig ground for nobody, but some one will have to dig through
every summer's hot day for you. You will build houses and make
clothes for no one, but many a rough hand must knead clay,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
and many an elbow be crooked to the stitch, to keep that body of yours
warm and fine. Now remember, whatever you and your work may be worth,
the less your keep costs, the better. It does not cost money only. It
costs degradation. You do not merely employ these people. You also
tread upon them. It cannot be helped;&mdash;you have your place, and
they have theirs; but see that you tread as lightly as possible, and
on as few as possible. What food, and clothes, and lodging, you
honestly need, for your health and peace, you may righteously take.
See that you take the plainest you can serve yourself with&mdash;that
you waste or wear nothing vainly&mdash;and that you employ no man in
furnishing you with any useless luxury."</p>

<p>130. That is the first lesson of Christian&mdash;or
human&mdash;economy; and depend upon it, my friend, it is a sound one,
and has every voice and vote of the spirits of Heaven and earth to
back it, whatever views the Manchester men, or any other manner of
men, may take respecting "demand and supply." Demand what you deserve,
and you shall be supplied with it, for your good. Demand what you do
<i>not</i> deserve, and you shall be supplied with something which you have
not demanded, and which Nature perceives that you deserve, quite to
the contrary of your good. That is the law of your existence, and if
you do not make it the law of your resolved acts, so much, precisely,
the worse for you and all connected with you.</p>

<p>131. Yet observe, though it is out of its proper place said
here, this law forbids no luxury which men are not degraded
in providing. You may have Paul Veronese to paint your
ceiling, if you like, or Benvenuto Cellini to make cups for
you. But you must not employ a hundred divers to find
beads to stitch over your sleeve.  (Did you see the account
of the sales of the Esterhazy jewels the other day?)</p>

<p>And the degree in which you recognize the difference between these two
kinds of services, is precisely what makes the difference between your being
a civilized person or a barbarian. If you keep slaves to furnish forth your
dress&mdash;to glut your stomach&mdash;sustain your indolence&mdash;or deck your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
pride, you are a barbarian. If you keep servants, properly cared for, to
furnish you with what you verily want, and no more than that&mdash;you
are a "civil" person&mdash;a person capable of the qualities of
citizenship.<a name="FNanchor_A_14" id="FNanchor_A_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_14" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>132.  Now, farther, observe that in a truly civilized and
disciplined state, no man would be allowed to meddle with
any material who did not know how to make the best of it.
In other words, the arts of working in wood, clay, stone, and
metal, would all be <i>fine</i> arts (working in iron for machinery
becoming an entirely distinct business). There would be no
joiner's work, no smith's, no pottery nor stone-cutting, so
debased in character as to be entirely unconnected with the
finer branches of the same art; and to at least one of these
finer branches (generally in metal-work) every painter and
sculptor would be necessarily apprenticed during some years
of his education. There would be room, in these four trades
alone, for nearly every grade of practical intelligence and
productive imagination.</p>

<p>133. But it should not be artists alone who are exercised
early in these crafts. It would be part of my scheme of
physical education that every youth in the state&mdash;from the
King's son downwards,&mdash;should learn to do something finely
and thoroughly with his hand, so as to let him know what
<i>touch</i> meant; and what stout craftsmanship meant; and to
inform him of many things besides, which no man can learn
but by some severely accurate discipline in doing. Let him
once learn to take a straight shaving off a plank, or draw a
fine curve without faltering, or lay a brick level in its mortar;
and he has learned a multitude of other matters which no
lips of man could ever teach him. He might choose his
craft, but whatever it was, he should learn it to some sufficient
degree of true dexterity: and the result would be, in after
life, that among the middle classes a good deal of their house
furniture would be made, and a good deal of rough work,
more or less clumsily, but not ineffectively, got through, by
the master himself and his sons, with much furtherance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
their general health and peace of mind, and increase of innocent
domestic pride and pleasure, and to the extinction of a
great deal of vulgar upholstery and other mean handicraft.</p>

<p>134. Farther. A great deal of the vulgarity, and nearly
all the vice, of retail commerce, involving the degradation of
persons occupied in it, depends simply on the fact that their
minds are always occupied by the vital (or rather mortal)
question of profits. I should at once put an end to this
source of baseness by making all retail dealers merely salaried
officers in the employ of the trade guilds; the stewards,
that is to say, of the salable properties of those guilds, and
purveyors of such and such articles to a given number of
families. A perfectly well-educated person might, without
the least degradation, hold such an office as this, however
poorly paid; and it would be precisely the fact of his being
well educated which would enable him to fulfil his duties to
the public without the stimulus of direct profit. Of course
the current objection to such a system would be that no man,
for a regularly paid salary, would take pains to please his
customers; and the answer to that objection is, that if you
can train a man to so much unselfishness as to offer himself
fearlessly to the chance of being shot, in the course of his
daily duty, you can most assuredly, if you make it also a
point of honor with him, train him to the amount of self-denial
involved in looking you out with care such a piece
of cheese or bacon as you have asked for.</p>

<p>135. You see that I have already much diminished the
number of employments involving degradation; and raised
the character of many of those that are left. There remain
to be considered the necessarily painful or mechanical works
of mining, forging, and the like: the unclean, noisome, or
paltry manufactures&mdash;the various kinds of transport&mdash;(by
merchant shipping, etc.) and the conditions of menial service.</p>

<p>It will facilitate the examination of these if we put them
for the moment aside, and pass to the other division of our
dilemma, the question, namely, what kind of lives our gentlemen
and ladies are to live, for whom all this hard work is to
be done.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_13" id="Footnote_A_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_13"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
Many of my working readers have disputed this statement eagerly,
feeling the good effect of work in themselves; but observe, I only say,
<i>simply</i> or <i>totally</i> manual work; and that, alone, <i>is</i> degrading, though
often in measure, refreshing, wholesome, and necessary. So it is
highly necessary and wholesome to eat sometimes; but degrading to
eat all day, as to labor with the hands all day. But it is not degrading
to think all day&mdash;if you can. A highly-bred court lady, rightly interested
in politics and literature, is a much finer type of the human
creature than a servant of all work, however clever and honest.</p></div>

<p class="subhead">OF THE NORMAL POSITION AND DUTIES OF THE UPPER CLASSES.
GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE LAND QUESTION.</p>


<p class="date"><i>April 17, 1867.</i></p>

<p>136. In passing now to the statement of conditions affecting
the interests of the upper classes, I would rather have addressed
these closing letters to one of themselves than to you,
for it is with their own faults and needs that each class is
primarily concerned. As, however, unless I kept the letters
private, this change of their address would be but a matter
of courtesy and form, not of any true prudential use; and as
besides I am now no more inclined to reticence&mdash;prudent or
otherwise; but desire only to state the facts of our national
economy as clearly and completely as may be, I pursue the
subject without respect of persons.</p>

<p>137. Before examining what the occupation and estate of
the upper classes ought, as far as may reasonably be conjectured,
finally to become, it will be well to set down in brief
terms what they actually have been in past ages: for this, in
many respects, they must also always be. The upper classes,
broadly speaking, are originally composed of the best-bred
(in the mere animal sense of the term), the most energetic,
and most thoughtful, of the population, who either by strength
of arm seize the land from the rest, and make slaves of them,
or bring desert land into cultivation, over which they have
therefore, within certain limits, true personal right; or, by
industry, accumulate other property, or by choice devote
themselves to intellectual pursuits, and, though poor, obtain
an acknowledged superiority of position, shown by benefits
conferred in discovery, or in teaching, or in gifts of art.
This is all in the simple course of the law of nature; and the
proper offices of the upper classes, thus distinguished from
the rest, become, therefore, in the main threefold:&mdash;</p>

<p>138. (A) Those who are strongest of arm have for their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
proper function the restraint and punishment of vice, and the
general maintenance of law and order; releasing only from its
original subjection to their power that which truly deserves
to be emancipated.</p>

<p>(B) Those who are superior by forethought and industry,
have for their function to be the providences of the foolish,
the weak, and the idle; and to establish such systems of trade
and distribution of goods as shall preserve the lower orders
from perishing by famine, or any other consequence of their
carelessness or folly, and to bring them all, according to each
man's capacity, at last into some harmonious industry.</p>

<p>(C) The third class, of scholars and artists, of course, have
for function the teaching and delighting of the inferior multitude.</p>

<p>The office of the upper classes, then, as a body, is to keep
order among their inferiors, and raise them always to the
nearest level with themselves of which those inferiors are
capable. So far as they are thus occupied, they are invariably
loved and reverenced intensely by all beneath them, and
reach, themselves, the highest types of human power and
beauty.</p>

<p>139. This, then, being the natural ordinance and function
of aristocracy, its corruption, like that of all other beautiful
things under the Devil's touch, is a very fearful one. Its
corruption is, that those who ought to be the rulers and guides
of the people, forsake their task of painful honorableness;
seek their own pleasure and pre-eminence only; and use their
power, subtlety, conceded influence, prestige of ancestry, and
mechanical instrumentality of martial power, to make the
lower orders toil for them, and feed and clothe them for
nothing, and become in various ways their living property,
goods, and chattels, even to the point of utter regardlessness
of whatever misery these serfs may suffer through such insolent
domination, or they themselves, their masters, commit
of crime to enforce it.</p>

<p>140. And this is especially likely to be the case when
means of various and tempting pleasures are put within the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
reach of the upper classes by advanced conditions of national
commerce and knowledge: and it is <i>certain</i> to be the case
as soon as position among those upper classes becomes
any way purchasable with money, instead of being the assured
measure of some kind of worth, (either strength of
hand, or true wisdom of conduct, or imaginative gift). It
has been becoming more and more the condition of the aristocracy
of Europe, ever since the fifteenth century; and is
gradually bringing about its ruin, and in that ruin, checked
only by the power which here and there a good soldier or
true statesman achieves over the putrid chaos of its vain
policy, the ruin of all beneath it; which can be arrested only,
either by the repentance of that old aristocracy, (hardly to
be hoped,) or by the stern substitution of other aristocracy
worthier than it.</p>

<p>141. Corrupt as it may be, it and its laws together, I would
at this moment, if I could, fasten every one of its institutions
down with bands of iron, and trust for all progress and help
against its tyranny simply to the patience and strength of
private conduct. And if I had to choose, I would tenfold
rather see the tyranny of old Austria triumphant in the old
and new worlds, and trust to the chance (or rather the distant
certainty) of some day seeing a true Emperor born to its
throne, than, with every privilege of thought and act, run the
most distant risk of seeing the thoughts of the people of Germany
and England become like the thoughts of the people
of America.</p>

<p>My American friends, of whom one, Charles Eliot Norton,
of Cambridge, is the dearest I have in the world, tell me I
know nothing about America. It may be so, and they must
do me the justice to observe that I, therefore, usually <i>say</i>
nothing about America. But this much I have said, because
the Americans, as a nation, set their trust in liberty and in
equality, of which I detest the one, and deny the possibility
of the other; and because, also, as a nation, they are wholly
undesirous of Rest, and incapable of it; irreverent of themselves,
both in the present and in the future; discontented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
with what they are, yet having no ideal of anything which they desire to
become.<a name="FNanchor_A_15" id="FNanchor_A_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_15" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>142. But, however corrupted, the aristocracy of any nation may thus be
always divided into three great classes. First, the landed proprietors
and soldiers, essentially one political body (for the possession of
land can only be maintained by military power); secondly, the moneyed
men and leaders of commerce; thirdly, the professional men and masters
in science, art, and literature.</p>

<p>And we were to consider the proper duties of all these, and the laws
probably expedient respecting them. Whereupon, in the outset, we are
at once brought face to face with the great land question.</p>

<p>143. Great as it may be, it is wholly subordinate to those we have
hitherto been considering. The laws you make regarding methods of
labor, or to secure the genuineness of the things produced by it,
affect the entire moral state of the nation, and all possibility of
human happiness for them. The mode of distribution of the land only
affects their numbers. By this or that law respecting land you
decide whether the nation shall consist of fifty or of a hundred
millions. But by this or that law respecting work, you decide
whether the given number of millions shall be rogues, or honest
men;&mdash;shall be wretches, or happy men. And the question of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
numbers is wholly immaterial, compared with that of character;
or rather, its own materialness depends on the prior
determination of character. Make your nation consist of
knaves, and, as Emerson said long ago, it is but the case of
any other vermin&mdash;"the more, the worse." Or, to put the
matter in narrower limits, it is a matter of no final concern
to any parent whether he shall have two children, or four;
but matter of quite final concern whether those he has shall,
or shall not, deserve to be hanged. The great difficulty in
dealing with the land question at all arises from the false,
though very natural, notion on the part of many reformers,
and of large bodies of the poor, that the division of the land
among the said poor would be an immediate and everlasting
relief to them. An <i>immediate</i> relief it would be to the extent
of a small annual sum (you may easily calculate how little,
if you choose) to each of them; on the strength of which
accession to their finances, they would multiply into as much
extra personality as the extra pence would sustain, and at
that point be checked by starvation, exactly as they are now.</p>

<p>144. Any other form of pillage would benefit them only
in like manner; and, in reality, the difficult part of the question
respecting numbers, is, not where they shall be arrested,
but what shall be the method of their arrest.</p>

<p>An island of a certain size has standing room only for so
many people; feeding ground for a great many fewer than
could stand on it. Reach the limits of your feeding ground,
and you must cease to multiply, must emigrate or starve.
The modes in which the pressure is gradually brought to bear
on the population depend on the justice of your laws; but the
pressure itself must come at last, whatever the distribution of
the land. And arithmeticians seem to me a little slow to remark
the importance of the old child's puzzle about the nails
in the horseshoe&mdash;when it is populations that are doubling
themselves, instead of farthings.</p>

<p>145. The essential land question, then, is to be treated quite
separately from that of the methods of restriction of population.
The land question is&mdash;At what point will you resolve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
to stop? It is separate matter of discussion how you are to
stop at it.</p>

<p>And this essential land question&mdash;"At what point will you
stop?"&mdash;is itself two-fold. You have to consider first, by
what methods of land distribution you can maintain the greatest
number of healthy persons; and secondly, whether, if, by
any other mode of distribution and relative ethical laws, you
can raise their character, while you diminish their numbers,
such sacrifice should be made, and to what extent? I think it
will be better, for clearness' sake, to end this letter with the
putting of these two queries in their decisive form, and to reserve
suggestions of answer for my next.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_15" id="Footnote_A_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_15"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
Some following passages in this letter, containing personal references
which might, in permanence, have given pain or offense, are now
omitted&mdash;the substance of them being also irrelevant to my main
purpose. These few words about the American war, with which they
concluded, are, I think, worth retaining:&mdash;"All methods of right
government are to be communicated to foreign nations by perfectness of
example and gentleness of patiently expanded power, not suddenly, nor
at the bayonet's point. And though it is the duty of every nation to
interfere, at bayonet point, if they have the strength to do so, to
save any oppressed multitude, or even individual, from manifest
violence, it is wholly unlawful to interfere in such matter, except
with sacredly pledged limitation of the objects to be accomplished in
the oppressed person's favor, and with absolute refusal of all selfish
advantage and <i>increase of territory or of political power</i> which
might otherwise accrue from the victory."</p></div>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XXIII" id="LETTER_XXIII"></a>LETTER XXIII.</h2>
<p class="subhead">OF THE JUST TENURE OF LANDS: AND THE PROPER FUNCTIONS
OF HIGH PUBLIC OFFICERS.</p>

<p class="date"><i>20th April, 1867.</i></p>

<p>146. I must repeat to you, once more, before I proceed,
that I only enter on this part of our inquiry to complete the
sequence of its system, and explain fully the bearing of
former conclusions, and not for any immediately practicable
good to be got out of the investigation. Whatever I have
hitherto urged upon you, it is in the power of all men quietly
to promote, and finally to secure, by the patient resolution
of personal conduct; but no action could be taken in re-distribution
of land or in limitation of the incomes of the upper
classes, without grave and prolonged civil disturbance.</p>

<p>Such disturbance, however, is only too likely to take place,
if the existing theories of political economy are allowed
credence much longer. In the writings of the vulgar economists,
nothing more excites my indignation than the subterfuges
by which they endeavor to accommodate their pseudoscience
to the existing abuses of wealth, by disguising the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
true nature of rent. I will not waste time in exposing their
fallacies, but will put the truth for you into as clear a shape
as I can.</p>

<p>147. Rent, of whatever kind, is, briefly, the price continuously
paid for the loan of the property of another person. It
may be too little, or it may be just or exorbitant or altogether
unjustifiable, according to circumstances. Exorbitant
rents can only be exacted from ignorant or necessitous rent-payers:
and it is one of the most necessary conditions of state
economy that there should be clear laws to prevent such exaction.</p>

<p>148. I may interrupt myself for a moment to give you an
instance of what I mean. The most wretched houses of the
poor in London often pay ten or fifteen per cent. to the landlord;
and I have known an instance of sanitary legislation
being hindered, to the loss of many hundreds of lives, in order
that the rents of a nobleman, derived from the necessities of
the poor, might not be diminished. And it is a curious thing
to me to see Mr. J. S. Mill foaming at the mouth, and really
afflicted conscientiously, because he supposes one man to have
been unjustly hanged, while by his own failure, (I believe,
<i>wilful</i> failure)<a name="FNanchor_A_16" id="FNanchor_A_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_16" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
in stating clearly to the public one of the first elementary truths of
the science he professes, he is aiding and abetting the commission of
the cruelest possible form of murder on many thousands of persons
yearly, for the sake simply of putting money into the pockets of the
landlords. I felt this evil so strongly that I bought, in the worst
part of London, one freehold and one leasehold property, consisting of
houses inhabited by the lowest poor; in order to try what change in
their comfort and habits I could effect by taking only a just rent,
but that firmly. The houses of the leasehold pay me five per cent.;
the families that used to have one room in them have now two; and are
more orderly and hopeful besides; and there is a surplus still on the
rents they pay after I have taken my five per cent., with which, if all
goes well, they will eventually be able to buy twelve years of the lease
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
from me. The freehold pays three per cent., with similar results
in the comfort of the tenant. This is merely an example of what might
be done by firm State action in such matters.</p>

<p>149. Next, of wholly unjustifiable rents. These are for
things which are not, and which it is criminal to consider
as, personal or exchangeable property. Bodies of men, land,
water, and air, are the principal of these things.</p>

<p>Parenthetically, may I ask you to observe, that though a fearless
defender of some forms of slavery, I am no defender of the slave
<i>trade</i>. It is by a blundering confusion of ideas between
<i>governing</i> men, and <i>trading in</i> men, and by consequent
interference with the restraint, instead of only with the
sale, that most of the great errors in action have been caused
among the emancipation men. I am prepared, if the need be
clear to my own mind, and if the power is in my hands, to
throw men into prison, or any other captivity&mdash;to bind them or
to beat them&mdash;and force them, for such periods as I may judge
necessary, to any kind of irksome labor: and on occasion of
desperate resistance, to hang or shoot them. But I will not
<i>sell</i> them.</p>

<p>150. Bodies of men, or women, then (and much more, as
I said before, their souls), must not be bought or sold.
Neither must land, nor water, nor air, these being the necessary
sustenance of men's bodies and souls.</p>

<p>Yet all these may, on certain terms, be bound, or secured
in possession, to particular persons under certain conditions.
For instance, it may be proper, at a certain time, to give a
man permission to possess land, as you give him permission
to marry; and farther, if he wishes it and works for it, to
secure to him the land needful for his life; as you secure his
wife to him; and make both utterly his own, without in the
least admitting his right to buy other people's wives, or fields,
or to sell his own.</p>

<p>151. And the right action of a State respecting its land is,
indeed, to secure it in various portions to those of its citizens
who deserve to be trusted with it, according to their respective
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
desires and proved capacities; and after having so secured
it to each, to exercise only such vigilance over his treatment
of it as the State must give also to his treatment of his
wife and servants; for the most part leaving him free, but
interfering in cases of gross mismanagement or abuse of
power. And in the case of great old families, which always
ought to be, and in some measure, however decadent, still
truly are, the noblest monumental architecture of the kingdom,
living temples of sacred tradition and hero's religion,
so much land ought to be granted to them in perpetuity as
may enable them to live thereon with all circumstances of
state and outward nobleness; <i>but their income must in no
wise be derived from the rents of it</i>, nor must they be occupied
(even in the most distant or subordinately administered
methods), in the exaction of rents. That is not noblemen's
work. Their income must be fixed, and paid them by the
State, as the King's is.</p>

<p>152. So far from their land being to them a source of income, it
should be, on the whole, costly to them, great part of it being kept
in conditions of natural grace, which return no rent but their
loveliness; and the rest made, at whatever cost, exemplary in
perfection of such agriculture as develops the happiest peasant
life;<a name="FNanchor_A_17" id="FNanchor_A_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_17" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
agriculture which, as I will show you hereafter, must reject the aid
of all mechanism except that of instruments guided solely by the human
hand, or by animal, or directly natural forces; and which, therefore,
cannot compete for profitableness with agriculture carried on by aid
of machinery.</p>

<p>And now for the occupation of this body of men, maintained at fixed
perennial cost of the State.</p>

<p>153. You know I said I should want no soldiers of special skill or
pugnacity, for all my boys would be soldiers. But I assuredly want <i>captains</i>
of soldiers, of special skill and pugnacity. And also, I said I should
strongly object to the appearance of any lawyers in my territory; meaning,
however, by lawyers, people who live by arguing about law,&mdash;not people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
appointed to administer law; and people who live by eloquently
misrepresenting facts&mdash;not people appointed to discover
and plainly represent them.</p>

<p>Therefore, the youth of this landed aristocracy would be
trained, in my schools, to these two great callings, not <i>by</i>
which, but <i>in</i> which, they are to live.</p>

<p>They would be trained, all of them, in perfect science of
war, and in perfect science of essential law. And from their
body should be chosen the captains and the judges of England,
its advocates, and generally its State officers, all such
functions being held for fixed pay (as already our officers of
the Church and army are paid), and no function connected
with the administration of law ever paid by casual fee. And
the head of such family should, in his own right, having
passed due (and high) examination in the science of law, and
not otherwise, be a judge, law-ward or Lord, having jurisdiction
both in civil and criminal cases, such as our present
judges have, after such case shall have been fully represented
before, and received verdict from, a jury, composed exclusively
of the middle or lower orders, and in which no
member of the aristocracy should sit. But from the decision
of these juries, or from the Lord's sentence, there should be
a final appeal to a tribunal, the highest in the land, held
solely in the King's name, and over which, in the capital, the
King himself should preside, and therein give judgment on a
fixed number of days in each year;&mdash;and, in other places and
at other times, judges appointed by election (under certain
conditions) out of any order of men in the State (the election
being national, not provincial): and all causes brought before
these judges should be decided, without appeal, by their own
authority; not by juries. This, then, recasting it for you
into brief view, would be the entire scheme of state authorities:&mdash;</p>

<p>154. (1) The King: exercising, as part both of his prerogative
and his duty, the office of a supreme judge at stated
times in the central court of appeal of his kingdom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
(2) Supreme judges appointed by national election; exercising
sole authority in courts of final appeal.</p>

<p>(3) Ordinary judges, holding the office hereditarily under
conditions; and with power to add to their number (and
liable to have it increased if necessary by the King's appointment);
the office of such judges being to administer the national
laws under the decision of juries.</p>

<p>(4) State officers charged with the direction of public
agency in matters of public utility.</p>

<p>(5) Bishops, charged with offices of supervision and aid,
to family by family, and person by person.</p>

<p>(6) The officers of war, of various ranks.</p>

<p>(7) The officers of public instruction, of various ranks.</p>

<p>I have sketched out this scheme for you somewhat prematurely,
for I would rather have conducted you to it step by
step, and as I brought forward the reasons for the several parts
of it; but it is, on other grounds, desirable that you should
have it to refer to, as I go on.</p>

<p>155. Without depending anywise upon nomenclature, yet
holding it important as a sign and record of the meanings of
things, I may tell you further that I should call the elected
supreme judges, "Princes"; the hereditary judges,
"Lords"; and the officers of public guidance, "Dukes"; and
that the social rank of these persons would be very closely
correspondent to that implied by such titles under our present
constitution; only much more real and useful. And in conclusion
of this letter, I will but add, that if you, or other
readers, think it idle of me to write or dream of such things;
as if any of them were in our power, or within possibility
of any near realization, and above all, vain to write of them
to a workman at Sunderland: you are to remember what I
told you at the beginning, that I go on with this part of my
subject in some fulfilment of my long-conceived plan, too
large to receive at present any deliberate execution from my
failing strength; (being the body of the work to which
'Munera Pulveris' was intended merely as an introduction;)
and that I address it to you because I know that the working
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
men of England must, for some time, be the only body to
which we can look for resistance to the deadly influence of
moneyed power.</p>

<p>I intend, however, to write to you at this moment one more
letter, partly explanatory of minor details necessarily omitted
in this, and chiefly of the proper office of the soldier; and
then I must delay the completion of even this poor task until
after the days have turned, for I have quite other work to
do in the brightness of the full-opened spring.</p>

<p>156. P.S.&mdash;As I have used somewhat strong language,
both here and elsewhere, of the equivocations of the economists
on the subject of rent, I had better refer you to one
characteristic example. You will find in paragraph 5th and
6th of Book II., chap. 2, of Mr. Mill's 'Principles,' that the
right to tenure of land is based, by his admission, only on the
proprietor's being its improver.</p>

<p>Without pausing to dwell on the objection that land cannot
be improved beyond a certain point, and that, at the reaching
of that point, farther claim to tenure would cease, on Mr.
Mill's principle&mdash;take even this admission, with its proper
subsequent conclusion, that "in no sound theory of private
property was it ever contemplated that the proprietor of land
should be merely a sinecurist quartered on it." Now, had that
conclusion been farther followed, it would have compelled the
admission that all rent was unjustifiable which normally
maintained any person in idleness; which is indeed the whole
truth of the matter. But Mr. Mill instantly retreats from
this perilous admission; and after three or four pages of
discussion (quite accurate for <i>its</i> part) of the limits of power
in management of the land itself (which apply just as strictly
to the peasant proprietor as to the cottier's landlord), he begs
the whole question at issue in one brief sentence, slipped cunningly
into the middle of a long one which appears to be telling
all the other way, and in which the fatal assertion (of the
right to rent) nestles itself, as if it had been already proved,&mdash;thus&mdash;I
italicize the unproved assertion in which the venom
of the entire falsehood is concentrated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
"Even in the case of cultivated land, a man whom, though
only one among millions, the law permits to hold thousands
of acres as his single share, is not entitled to think that all is
given to him to use and abuse, and deal with it as if it concerned
nobody but himself. <i>The rents or profits which he
can obtain from it are his, and his only</i>; but with regard to
the land, in everything which he abstains from doing, he is
morally bound, and should, whenever the case admits, be
legally compelled to make his interest and pleasure consistent
with the public good."</p>

<p>157. I say, this sentence in italics is slipped <i>cunningly</i> into the
long sentence, as if it were of no great consequence; and above I have
expressed my belief that Mr. Mill's equivocations on this subject are
wilful. It is a grave accusation; but I cannot, by any stretch of
charity, attribute these misrepresentations to absolute dulness and
bluntness of brain, either in Mr. Mill or his follower, Mr. Fawcett.
Mr. Mill is capable of immense involuntary error; but his involuntary
errors are usually owing to his seeing only one or two of the many
sides of a thing; not to obscure sight of the side he <i>does</i> see. Thus
his 'Essay on Liberty' only takes cognizance of facts that make for
liberty, and of none that make for restraint. But in its statement of
all that can be said for liberty, it is so clear and keen, that I have
myself quoted it before now as the best authority on that side. And,
if arguing in favor of Rent, absolutely, and with clear explanation of
what it was, he had then defended it with all his might, I should have
attributed to him only the honest shortsightedness of partisanship;
but when I find his defining sentences full of subtle entanglement and
reserve&mdash;and that reserve held throughout his treatment of this
particular subject,&mdash;I cannot, whether I utter the suspicion or
not, keep the sense of wilfulness in the misrepresentation from
remaining in my mind. And if there be indeed ground for this
blame, and Mr. Mill, for fear of fostering political
agitation,<a name="FNanchor_A_18" id="FNanchor_A_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_18" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
<i>has</i> disguised <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
what he knows to be the facts about rent, I would ask
him as one of the leading members of the Jamaica Committee, which is
the greater crime, boldly to sign warrant for the sudden death of one
man, known to be an agitator, in the immediate outbreak of such
agitation, or, by equivocation in a scientific work, to sign warrants
for the deaths of thousands of men in slow misery, for <i>fear</i> of an
agitation which has not begun; and if begun, would be carried on by
debate, not by the sword?</p>

at last into tears in a mob's presence.&mdash;(Dec. 16th, 1867.)</p></div>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XXIV" id="LETTER_XXIV"></a>LETTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="subhead">THE OFFICE OF THE SOLDIER.</p>


<p class="date"><i>April 22, 1867.</i></p>

<p>158. I must once more deprecate your probable supposition
that I bring forward this ideal plan of State government,
either with any idea of its appearing, to our present public
mind, practicable even at a remote period, or with any positive
and obstinate adherence to the particular form suggested.
There are no wiser words among the many wise ones of the
most rational and keen-sighted of old English men of the
world, than these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"For forms of government let fools contest;<br />
That which is best administered is best."<br />
</p></div>

<p>For, indeed, no form of government is of any use among bad
men; and any form will work in the hands of the good; but
the essence of all government among good men is this, that it
is mainly occupied in the <i>production and recognition of human
worth</i>, and in the detection and extinction of human unworthiness;
and every Government which produces and recognizes
worth, will also inevitably use the worth it has found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to govern with; and therefore fall into some approximation to
such a system as I have described. And, as I told you, I do
not contend for names, nor particular powers&mdash;though I state
those which seem to me most advisable; on the contrary, I
know that the precise extent of authorities must be different
in every nation at different times, and ought to be so, according
to their circumstances and character; and all that I assert
with confidence is the necessity, within afterwards definable
limits, of <i>some such</i> authorities as these; that is to say,</p>

<p>159. I. An <i>observant</i> one:&mdash;by which all men shall be
looked after and taken note of.</p>

<p>II. A <i>helpful</i> one, from which those who need help may
get it.</p>

<p>III. A <i>prudential</i> one, which shall not let people dig in
wrong places for coal, nor make railroads where they are
not wanted; and which shall also, with true providence, insist
on their digging in right places for coal, in a safe manner,
and making railroads where they <i>are</i> wanted.</p>

<p>IV. A <i>martial</i> one, which will punish knaves and make
idle persons work.</p>

<p>V. An <i>instructive</i> one, which shall tell everybody what it
is their duty to know, and be ready pleasantly to answer questions
if anybody asks them.</p>

<p>VI. A <i>deliberate</i> and <i>decisive</i> one, which shall judge by
law, and amend or make law;</p>

<p>VII. An <i>exemplary</i> one, which shall show what is loveliest
in the art of life.</p>

<p>You may divide or name those several offices as you will,
or they may be divided in practice as expediency may recommend;
the plan I have stated merely puts them all into
the simplest forms and relations.</p>

<p>160. You see I have just defined the martial power as that
"which punishes knaves and makes idle persons work." For
that is indeed the ultimate and perennial soldiership; that is
the essential warrior's office to the end of time. "There
is no discharge in that war." To the compelling of sloth,
and the scourging of sin, the strong hand will have to address
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
itself as long as this wretched little dusty and volcanic world
breeds nettles, and spits fire. The soldier's office at present
is indeed supposed to be the defense of his country against
other countries; but that is an office which&mdash;Utopian as you
may think the saying&mdash;will soon now be extinct. I say so
fearlessly, though I say it with wide war threatened, at this
moment, in the East and West. For observe what the standing
of nations on their defense really means. It means that,
but for such armed attitude, each of them would go and rob
the other; that is to say, that the majority of active persons in
every nation are at present&mdash;thieves. I am very sorry that
this should still be so; but it will not be so long. National
exhibitions, indeed, will not bring peace; but national education
will, and that is soon coming. I can judge of this by
my own mind, for I am myself naturally as covetous a person
as lives in this world, and am as eagerly-minded to go and
steal some things the French have got, as any housebreaker
could be, having clue to attractive spoons. If I could by military
incursion carry off Paul Veronese's "Marriage in Cana,"
and the "Venus Victrix," and the "Hours of St. Louis," it
would give me the profoundest satisfaction to accomplish the
foray successfully; nevertheless, being a comparatively educated
person, I should most assuredly not give myself that
satisfaction, though there were not an ounce of gunpowder,
nor a bayonet, in all France. I have not the least mind to
rob anybody, however much I may covet what they have got;
and I know that the French and British public may and will,
with many other publics, be at last brought to be of this
mind also; and to see farther that a nation's real strength and
happiness do not depend on properties and territories, nor on
machinery for their defense; but on their getting such territory
as they <i>have</i>, well filled with none but respectable persons.
Which is a way of <i>infinitely</i> enlarging one's territory, feasible
to every potentate; and dependent no wise on getting Trent
turned, or Rhine-edge reached.</p>

<p>161. Not but that, in the present state of things, it may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
often be soldiers' duty to seize territory, and hold it strongly;
but only from banditti, or savage and idle persons.</p>

<p>Thus, both Calabria and Greece ought to have been irresistibly
occupied long ago. Instead of quarreling with Austria
about Venice, the Italians ought to have made a truce
with her for ten years, on condition only of her destroying no
monuments, and not taxing Italians more than Germans; and
then thrown the whole force of their army on Calabria, shot
down every bandit in it in a week, and forced the peasantry
of it into honest work on every hill-side, with stout and immediate
help from the soldiers in embanking streams, building
walls, and the like; and Italian finance would have been
a much pleasanter matter for the King to take account of by
this time; and a fleet might have been floating under Garganus
strong enough to sweep every hostile sail out of the Adriatic,
instead of a disgraced and useless remnant of one, about to
be put up to auction.</p>

<p>And similarly, <i>we</i> ought to have occupied Greece instantly,
when they asked us, whether Russia liked it or not; given
them an English king, made good roads for them, and stout
laws; and kept them, and their hills and seas, with righteous
shepherding of Arcadian fields, and righteous ruling of Salaminian
wave, until they could have given themselves a Greek
king of men again; and obeyed him, like men.</p>

<p class="date"><i>April 24.</i></p>

<p>162. It is strange that just before I finish work for this
time, there comes the first real and notable sign of the victory
of the principles I have been fighting for, these seven years.
It is only a newspaper paragraph, but it means much. Look
at the second column of the 11th page of yesterday's 'Pall
Mall Gazette,' The paper has taken a wonderful fit of misprinting
lately (unless my friend John Simon has been
knighted on his way to Weimar, which would be much too
right and good a thing to be a likely one); but its straws of
talk mark which way the wind blows perhaps more early than
those of any other journal&mdash;and look at the question it puts
in that page, "Whether political economy be the sordid and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
materialistic science some account it, or almost the noblest on
which thought can be employed?" Might not you as well
have determined that question a little while ago, friend Public?
and known what political economy <i>was</i>, before you talked
so much about it?</p>

<p>But, hark, again&mdash;"Ostentation, parental pride and a host
of moral" (immoral?) "qualities must be recognized as
among the springs of industry; political economy should not
ignore these, but, to discuss them, <i>it must abandon its pretensions
to the precision of a pure science</i>."</p>

<p>163. Well done the 'Pall Mall'! Had it written "Prudence
and parental affection," instead of "Ostentation and
parental pride," "must be recognized among the springs of
industry," it would have been still better; and it would then
have achieved the expression of a part of the truth, which
I put into clear terms in the first sentence of 'Unto this Last,'
in the year 1862&mdash;which it has thus taken five years to get
half way into the public's head.</p>

<p>"Among the delusions which at different periods have possessed
themselves of the minds of large masses of the human
race, perhaps the most curious&mdash;certainly the least creditable&mdash;is
the modern <i>soi-disant</i> science of political economy, based
on the idea that an advantageous code of social action may be
determined, irrespectively of the influence of social affection."</p>

<p>Look also at the definition of skill, p. 87.</p>

<p>"Under the term 'skill' I mean to include the united
force of experience, intellect, and passion, in their operation
on manual labor, and under the term 'passion' to include
the entire range of the moral feelings."</p>

<p>164. I say half way into the public's head, because you
see, a few lines further on, the 'Pall Mall' hopes for a pause
"half way between the rigidity of Ricardo and the sentimentality
of Ruskin."</p>

<p>With one hand on their pocket, and the other on their
heart! Be it so for the present; we shall see how long this
statuesque attitude can be maintained; meantime, it chances
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
strangely&mdash;as several other things have chanced while I was
writing these notes to you&mdash;that they should have put in that
sneer (two lines before) at my note on the meaning of the
Homeric and Platonic Sirens, at the very moment when I was
doubting whether I would or would not tell you the significance
of the last song of Ariel in 'The Tempest.'</p>

<p>I had half determined not, but now I shall. And this was
what brought me to think of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>165. Yesterday afternoon I called on Mr. H. C. Sorby,
to see some of the results of an inquiry he has been following
all last year, into the nature of the coloring matter of leaves
and flowers.</p>

<p>You most probably have heard (at all events, may with
little trouble hear) of the marvelous power which chemical
analysis has received in recent discoveries respecting the laws
of light.</p>

<p>My friend showed me the rainbow of the rose, and the
rainbow of the violet, and the rainbow of the hyacinth, and
the rainbow of forest leaves being born, and the rainbow of
forest leaves dying.</p>

<p>And, last, he showed me the rainbow of blood. It was
but the three-hundredth part of a grain, dissolved in a drop
of water; and it cast its measured bars, for ever recognizable
now to human sight, on the chord of the seven colors. And no
drop of that red rain can now be shed, so small as that the
stain of it cannot be known, and the voice of it heard out of
the ground.</p>

<p>166. But the seeing these flower colors, and the iris of blood
together with them, just while I was trying to gather into
brief space the right laws of war, brought vividly back to me
my dreaming fancy of long ago, that even the trees of the
earth were "capable of a kind of sorrow, as they opened their
innocent leaves in vain for men; and along the dells of England
her beeches cast their dappled shades only where the
outlaw drew his bow, and the king rode his careless chase;
amidst the fair defiles of the Apennines, the twisted olive-trunks
hid the ambushes of treachery, and on their meadows,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
day by day, the lilies, which were white at the dawn, were
washed with crimson at sunset."</p>

<p>And so also now this chance word of the daily journal,
about the Sirens, brought to my mind the divine passage in
the Cratylus of Plato, about the place of the dead.</p>

<p>"And none of those who dwell there desire to depart
thence,&mdash;no, not even the Sirens; but even they, the seducers,
are there themselves beguiled, and they who lulled all men,
themselves laid to rest&mdash;they, and all others&mdash;such sweet
songs doth death know how to sing to them."</p>

<p>So also the Hebrew.</p>

<p>"And desire shall fail, because man goeth to his long
home." For you know I told you the Sirens were not pleasures,
but desires; being always represented in old Greek art
as having human faces, with birds' wings and feet; and
sometimes with eyes upon their wings; and there are not two
more important passages in all literature, respecting the laws
of labor and of life, than those two great descriptions of
the Sirens in Homer and Plato,&mdash;the Sirens of death, and
Sirens of eternal life, representing severally the earthly and
heavenly desires of men; the heavenly desires singing to the
motion of circles of the spheres, and the earthly on the rocks
of fatalest shipwreck. A fact which may indeed be regarded
"sentimentally," but it is also a profoundly important politico-economical
one.</p>

<p>And now for Shakespeare's song.</p>

<p>167. You will find, if you look back to the analysis of it,
given in 'Munera Pulveris,' &sect; 134, that the whole play of
'The Tempest' is an allegorical representation of the powers
of true, and therefore spiritual, Liberty, as opposed to true,
and therefore carnal and brutal Slavery. There is not a sentence
nor a rhyme, sung or uttered by Ariel or Caliban,
throughout the play, which has not this under-meaning.</p>

<p>168. Now the fulfilment of all human liberty is in the
peaceful inheritance of the earth, with its "herb yielding
seed, and fruit tree yielding fruit" after his kind; the
pasture, or arable, land, and the blossoming, or wooded and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
fruited, land uniting the final elements of life and peace,
for body and soul. Therefore, we have the two great Hebrew
forms of benediction, "His eyes shall be red with wine,
and his teeth white with milk," and again, "Butter and honey
shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and choose
the good." And as the work of war and sin has always been
the devastation of this blossoming earth, whether by spoil
or idleness, so the work of peace and virtue is also that of the
first day of Paradise, to "Dress it and to keep it." And that
will always be the song of perfectly accomplished Liberty,
in her industry, and rest, and shelter from troubled thoughts
in the calm of the fields, and gaining, by migration, the long
summer's day from the shortening twilight:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Where the bee sucks, there lurk I;<br />
In a cowslip's bell I lie;<br />
There I couch when owls do cry.<br />
On the bat's back I do fly<br />
After summer merrily:<br />
Merrily, merrily, shall I live now<br />
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough."<br />

<p>And the security of this treasure to all the poor, and not the
ravage of it down the valleys of the Shenandoah, is indeed the
true warrior's work. But, that they may be able to restrain
vice rightly, soldiers must themselves be first in virtue; and
that they may be able to compel labor sternly, they must themselves
be first in toil, and their spears, like Jonathan's at
Bethaven, enlighteners of the eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XXV" id="LETTER_XXV"></a>LETTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF INEVITABLE DISTINCTION OF RANK, AND NECESSARY SUBMISSION
TO AUTHORITY. THE MEANING OF PURE-HEARTEDNESS. CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>169. I was interrupted yesterday, just as I was going to
set my soldiers to work; and to-day, here comes the pamphlet
you promised me, containing the Debates about Church-going,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
in which I find so interesting a text for my concluding letter
that I must still let my soldiers stand at ease for a little while.
Look at its twenty-fifth page, and you will find, in the speech
of Mr. Thomas, (carpenter,) this beautiful explanation of
the admitted change in the general public mind, of which Mr.
Thomas, for his part, highly approves, (the getting out of
the unreasonable habit of paying respect to anybody.) There
were many reasons to Mr. Thomas's mind why the working
classes did not attend places of worship: one was, that "the
parson was regarded as an object of reverence. In the little
town he came from, if a poor man did not make a bow to the
parson he was a marked man. This was no doubt wearing
away to a great extent" (the base habit of making bows),
"because, the poor man was beginning to get education, and
to think for himself. It was only while the priest kept the
press from him that he was kept ignorant, and was compelled
to bow, as it were, to the parson.... It was the case all over
England. The clergyman seemed to think himself something
superior. Now he (Mr. Thomas) did not admit there was
any inferiority" (laughter, audience throughout course of
meeting mainly in the right), "except, perhaps, on the score
of his having received a classical education, which the poor
man could not get."</p>

<p>Now, my dear friend, here is the element which is the veriest devil
of all that have got into modern flesh; this infidelity of the nineteenth
century St. Thomas in there being anything better than himself
alive;<a name="FNanchor_A_19" id="FNanchor_A_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_19" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
coupled, as it always is, with the farther resolution&mdash;if unwillingly
convinced of the fact,&mdash;to seal the Better living thing down again
out of his way, under the first stone handy. I had not intended, till
we entered on the second section of our inquiry, namely, into the
influence of gentleness (having hitherto, you see, been wholly concerned
with that of justice), to give you the clue out of our dilemma about
equalities produced by education; but by the speech of our superior
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
carpenter, I am driven into it at once, and it is perhaps as well.</p>

<p>170. The speech is not, observe, without its own root of
truth at the bottom of it, nor at all, as I think, ill intended
by the speaker; but you have in it a clear instance of what I
was saying in the sixteenth of these letters,&mdash;that education
<i>was desired by the lower orders because they thought it would
make them upper orders</i>, and be a leveler and effacer of
distinctions. They will be mightily astonished, when they
really get it, to find that it is, on the contrary, the fatalest
of all discerners and enforcers of distinctions; piercing, even
to the division of the joints and marrow, to find out wherein
your body and soul are less, or greater, than other bodies
and souls, and to sign deed of separation with unequivocal
seal.</p>

<p>171. Education is, indeed, of all differences not divinely
appointed, an instant effacer and reconciler. Whatever is
undivinely poor, it will make rich; whatever is undivinely
maimed, and halt, and blind, it will make whole, and equal,
and seeing. The blind and the lame are to it as to David
at the siege of the Tower of the Kings, "hated of David's
soul." But there are other divinely-appointed differences,
eternal as the ranks of the everlasting hills, and as the
strength of their ceaseless waters. And these, education
does <i>not</i> do away with; but measures, manifests, and employs.</p>

<p>In the handful of shingle which you gather from the sea-beach,
which the indiscriminate sea, with equality of fraternal
foam, has only educated to be, every one, round, you will
see little difference between the noble and mean stones. But
the jeweler's trenchant education of them will tell you
another story. Even the meanest will be better for it, but
the noblest so much better that you can class the two together
no more. The fair veins and colors are all clear now, and
so stern is nature's intent regarding this, that not only will
the polish show which is best, but the best will take most
polish. You shall not merely see they have more virtue
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
than the others, but see that more of virtue more clearly;
and the less virtue there is, the more dimly you shall see
what there is of it.</p>

<p>172. And the law about education, which is sorrowfulest
to vulgar pride, is this&mdash;that all its gains are at compound
interest; so that, as our work proceeds, every hour throws
us farther behind the greater men with whom we began on
equal terms. Two children go to school hand in hand, and
spell for half an hour over the same page. Through all
their lives, never shall they spell from the same page more.
One is presently a page ahead,&mdash;two pages, ten pages,&mdash;and
evermore, though each toils equally, the interval enlarges&mdash;at
birth nothing, at death, infinite.</p>

<p>173. And by this you may recognize true education from
false. False education is a delightful thing, and warms
you, and makes you every day think more of yourself. And
true education is a deadly cold thing with a Gorgon's head
on her shield, and makes you every day think worse of
yourself.</p>

<p>Worse in two ways, also, more's the pity. It is perpetually
increasing the personal sense of ignorance and the
personal sense of fault. And this last is the truth which is
at the bottom of the common evangelical notion about conversion,
and which the Devil has got hold of, and hidden,
until, instead of seeing and confessing personal ignorance
and fault, as compared with the sense and virtue of others,
people see nothing but corruption in human nature, and
shelter their own sins under accusation of their race (the
worst of all assertions of equality and fraternity). And so
they avoid the blessed and strengthening pain of finding out
wherein they are fools, as compared with other men, by
calling everybody else a fool too; and avoid the pain of discerning
their own faults, by vociferously claiming their share
in the great capital of original sin.</p>

<p>I must also, therefore, tell you here what properly ought
to have begun the next following section of our subject&mdash;the
point usually unnoticed in the parable of the Prodigal Son.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
174. First, have you ever observed that all Christ's main
teachings, by direct order, by earnest parable, and by His
own permanent emotion, regard the use and misuse of <i>money</i>?
We might have thought, if we had been asked what a divine
teacher was most likely to teach, that he would have left
inferior persons to give directions about money; and himself
spoken only concerning faith and love, and the discipline of
the passions, and the guilt of the crimes of soul against soul.
But not so. He speaks in general terms of these. But He
does not speak parables about them for all men's memory,
nor permit Himself fierce indignation against them, in all
men's sight. The Pharisees bring Him an adulteress. He
writes her forgiveness on the dust of which He had formed
her. Another, despised of all for known sin, He recognized
as a giver of unknown love. But He acknowledges no love
in buyers and sellers in His house. One should have thought
there were people in that house twenty times worse than
they;&mdash;Caiaphas and his like&mdash;false priests, false prayer-makers,
false leaders of the people&mdash;who needed putting to
silence, or to flight, with darkest wrath. But the scourge is
only against the <i>traffickers and thieves</i>. The two most intense
of all the parables: the two which lead the rest in love
and terror (this of the Prodigal, and of Dives), relate, both
of them, to management of riches. The practical order given
to the only seeker of advice, of whom it is recorded that
Christ "loved him," is briefly about his property. "Sell
that thou hast."</p>

<p>And the arbitrament of the day of the Last Judgment is
made to rest wholly, neither on belief in God, nor in any
spiritual virtue in man, nor on freedom from stress of
stormy crime, but on this only, "I was an hungered and ye
gave me drink; naked, and ye clothed me; sick, and ye came
unto me."</p>

<p>175. Well, then, the first thing I want you to notice in
the parable of the Prodigal Son (and the last thing which
people usually <i>do</i> notice in it), is&mdash;that it is about a Prodigal!
He begins by asking for his share of his father's goods;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
he gets it, carries it off, and wastes it. It is true that he
wastes it in riotous living, but you are not asked to notice in
what kind of riot; he spends it with harlots&mdash;but it is not
the harlotry which his elder brother accuses him of mainly,
but of having devoured his father's living. Nay, it is not
the sensual life which he accuses himself of&mdash;or which the
manner of his punishment accuses him of. But the <i>wasteful</i>
life. It is not said that he had become debauched in soul, or
diseased in body, by his vice; but that at last he would fain
have filled his belly with husks, and could not. It is not said
that he was struck with remorse for the consequences of his
evil passions, but only that he remembered there was bread
enough and to spare, even for the servants, at home.</p>

<p>Now, my friend, do not think I want to extenuate sins of
passion (though, in very truth, the sin of Magdalene is a
light one compared to that of Judas); but observe, sins of
passion, if of <i>real</i> passion, are often the errors and backfalls
of noble souls; but prodigality is mere and pure selfishness,
and essentially the sin of an ignoble or undeveloped creature;
and I would rather, ten times rather, hear of a youth that
(certain degrees of temptation and conditions of resistance
being understood) he had fallen into any sin you chose to
name, of all the mortal ones, than that he was in the habit
of running bills which he could not pay.</p>

<p>Farther, though I hold that the two crowning and most
accursed sins of the society of this present day are the carelessness
with which it regards the betrayal of women, and
the brutality with which it suffers the neglect of children,
both these head and chief crimes, and all others, are rooted
first in abuse of the laws, and neglect of the duties concerning
wealth. And thus the love of money, with the parallel
(and, observe, <i>mathematically commensurate</i> looseness in
management of it), the "mal tener," followed necessarily by
the "mal dare," is, indeed, the root of all evil.</p>

<p>176. Then, secondly, I want you to note that when the
prodigal comes to his senses, he complains of nobody but
himself, and speaks of no unworthiness but his own. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
says nothing against any of the women who tempted him&mdash;nothing
against the citizen who left him to feed on husks&mdash;nothing
of the false friends of whom "no man gave unto
him"&mdash;above all, nothing of the "corruption of human
nature," or the corruption of things in general. He says
that <i>he himself</i> is unworthy, as distinguished from honorable
persons, and that <i>he himself</i> has sinned, as distinguished
from righteous persons. And <i>that</i> is the hard lesson to learn,
and the beginning of faithful lessons. All right and fruitful
humility, and purging of heart, and seeing of God, is in that.
It is easy to call yourself the chief of sinners, expecting every
sinner round you to decline&mdash;or return&mdash;the compliment;
but learn to measure the real degrees of your own relative
baseness, and to be ashamed, not in heaven's sight, but in
man's sight; and redemption is indeed begun. Observe the
phrase, I have sinned "<i>against</i> heaven," against the great
law of that, and <i>before</i> thee, visibly degraded before my
human sire and guide, unworthy any more of being esteemed
of his blood, and desirous only of taking the place I deserve
among his servants.</p>

<p>177. Now, I do not doubt but that I shall set many a
reader's teeth on edge by what he will think my carnal and
material rendering of this "beautiful" parable. But I am
just as ready to spiritualize it as he is, provided I am sure
first that we understand it. If we want to understand the
parable of the sower, we must first think of it as of literal
husbandry; if we want to understand the parable of the
prodigal, we must first understand it as of literal prodigality.
And the story has also for us a precious lesson in this
literal sense of it, namely this, which I have been urging
upon you throughout these letters, that all redemption must
begin in subjection and in the recovery of the sense of
Fatherhood and authority, as all ruin and desolation begin
in the loss of that sense. The lost son began by claiming his
rights. He is found when he resigns them. He is lost by
flying from his father, when his father's authority was only
paternal. He is found by returning to his father, and desiring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
that his authority may be absolute, as over a hired
stranger.</p>

<p>And this is the practical lesson I want to leave with you,
and all other working men.</p>

<p>178. You are on the eve of a great political crisis; and
every rascal with a tongue in his head will try to make his
own stock out of you. Now this is the test you must try
them with. Those that say to you, "Stand up for your
rights&mdash;get your division of living&mdash;be sure that you are as
well off as others, and have what they have!&mdash;don't let any
man dictate to you&mdash;have not you all a right to your opinion?&mdash;are
you not all as good as everybody else?&mdash;let us have no
governors, or fathers&mdash;let us all be free and alike." Those,
I say, who speak thus to you, take Nelson's rough order for&mdash;and
hate them as you do the Devil, for they <i>are</i> his ambassadors.
But those, the few, who have the courage to say to
you, "My friends, you and I, and all of us, have somehow
got very wrong; we've been hardly treated, certainly; but
here we are in a piggery, mainly by our own fault, hungry
enough, and for ourselves, anything but respectable: we <i>must</i>
get out of this; there are certainly laws we may learn to live
by, and there are wiser people than we are in the world, and
kindly ones, if we can find our way to them; and an infinitely
wise and kind Father, above all of them and us, if we can
but find our way to <i>Him</i>, and ask Him to take us for servants,
and put us to any work He will, so that we may never
leave Him more." The people who will say that to you, and
(for by <i>no</i> saying, but by their fruits, only, you shall finally
know them) who are themselves orderly and kindly, and do
their own business well,&mdash;take <i>those</i> for your guides, and
trust them; on ice and rock alike, tie yourselves well together
with them, and with much scrutiny, and cautious walking
(perhaps nearly as much back as forward, at first), you will
verily get off the glacier, and into meadow land, in God's
time.</p>

<p>179. I meant to have written much to you respecting the
meaning of that word "hired servants," and to have gone on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to the duties of soldiers, for you know "Soldier" means a
person who is paid to fight with regular pay&mdash;literally with
"soldi" or "sous"&mdash;the "penny a day" of the vineyard
laborers; but I can't now: only just this much, that our
whole system of work must be based on the nobleness of
soldiership&mdash;so that we shall all be soldiers of either plowshare
or sword; and literally all our actual and professed
soldiers, whether professed for a time only, or for life, must
be kept to hard work of hand, when not in actual war; their
honor consisting in being set to service of more pain and
danger than others; to life-boat service; to redeeming of
ground from furious rivers or sea&mdash;or mountain ruin; to
subduing wild and unhealthy land, and extending the confines
of colonies in the front of miasm and famine, and savage
races.</p>

<p>And much of our harder home work must be done in a
kind of soldiership, by bands of trained workers sent from
place to place and town to town; doing, with strong and
sudden hand, what is needed for help, and setting all things
in more prosperous courses for the future.</p>

<p>Of all which I hope to speak in its proper place after we
know what offices the higher arts of gentleness have among
the lower ones of force, and how their prevalence may gradually
change spear to pruning-hook, over the face of all the
earth.</p>

<p>180. And now&mdash;but one word more&mdash;either for you, or
any other readers who may be startled at what I have been
saying, as to the peculiar stress laid by the Founder of our
religion on right dealing with wealth. Let them be assured
that it is with no fortuitous choice among the attributes or
powers of evil, that "Mammon" is assigned for the direct
adversary of the Master whom they are bound to serve. You
cannot, by any artifice of reconciliation, be God's soldier, and
his. Nor while the desire of gain is within your heart, can
any true knowledge of the Kingdom of God come there. No
one shall enter its stronghold,&mdash;no one receive its blessing,
except, "he that hath clean hands and a pure heart;" clean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
hands that have done no cruel deed,&mdash;pure heart, that knows
no base desire. And, therefore, in the highest spiritual sense
that can be given to words, be assured, not respecting the
literal temple of stone and gold, but of the living temple of
your body and soul, that no redemption, nor teaching, nor
hallowing, will be anywise possible for it, until these two
verses have been, for it also, fulfilled:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And He went into the temple, and began to cast out them
that sold therein, and them that bought. And He taught
daily in the temple."</p>

<h5>Page 21.&mdash;<i>Expenditure on Science and Art.</i></h5>


<p>The following is the passage referred to. The fact it relates
is so curious, and so illustrative of our national interest
in science, that I do not apologize for the repetition:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Two years ago there was a collection of the fossils of Solenhofen to
be sold in Bavaria; the best in existence, containing many specimens
unique for perfectness, and one, unique as an example of a species (a
whole kingdom of unknown living creatures being announced by that
fossil). This collection, of which the mere market worth, among
private buyers, would probably have been some thousand or twelve
hundred pounds, was offered to the English nation for seven hundred:
but we would not give seven hundred, and the whole series would have
been in the Munich museum at this moment, if Professor
Owen<a name="FNanchor_A_20" id="FNanchor_A_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_20" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
had not, with loss of his own time, and patient tormenting of the
British public in the person of its representatives, got leave to give
four hundred pounds at once, and himself become answerable for the
other three!&mdash;which the said public will doubtless pay him
eventually, but sulkily, and caring nothing about the matter all the
while; only always ready to cackle if any credit comes of it.
Consider, I beg of you, arithmetically, what this fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
means. Your annual expenditure for public purposes (a
third of it for military apparatus) is at least fifty millions.
Now seven hundred pounds is to fifty million pounds,
roughly, as seven pence to two thousand pounds. Suppose,
then, a gentleman of unknown income, but whose wealth was
to be conjectured from the fact that he spent two thousand
a year on his park walls and footmen only, professes himself
fond of science; and that one of his servants comes eagerly
to tell him that an unique collection of fossils, giving clue to
a new era of creation, is to be had for the sum of sevenpence
sterling; and that the gentleman who is fond of science, and
spends two thousand a year on his park, answers, after keeping
his servant waiting several months, 'Well, I'll give you
fourpence for them, if you will be answerable for the extra
threepence yourself till next year.'"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_20" id="Footnote_A_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_20"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
I originally stated this fact without Professor Owen's permission;
which, of course, he could not with propriety have granted, had I
asked it; but I considered it so important that the public should be
aware of the fact, that I did what seemed to me right, though rude.</p></div>

<h5>Page 33.&mdash;<i>Legislation of Frederick the Great.</i></h5>


<p>The following are the portions of Mr. Dixon's letters referred
to:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I am now busy with Frederick the Great; I am
not now astonished that Carlyle calls him Great, neither that
this work of his should have had such a sad effect upon him
in producing it, when I see the number of volumes he must
have had to wade through to produce such a clear terse set
of utterances; and yet I do not feel the work as a book likely
to do a reader of it the good that some of his other books
will do. It is truly awful to read these battles after battles,
lies after lies, called Diplomacy; it's fearful to read all this,
and one wonders how he that set himself to this&mdash;He, of all
men&mdash;could have the rare patience to produce such a labored,
heart-rending piece of work. Again, when one reads of the
stupidity, the shameful waste of our moneys by our forefathers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
to see our National Debt (the curse to our labor now,
the millstone to our commerce, to our fair chance of competition
in our day) thus created, and for what? Even Carlyle
cannot tell; then how are we to tell? Now, who will deliver
us? that is the question; who will help us in these days of
<i>idle or no work</i>, while our foreign neighbors have plenty and
are actually selling their produce to our men of capital
cheaper than we can make it? House-rent getting dearer,
taxes getting dearer, rates, clothing, food, etc. Sad times,
my master, do seem to have fallen upon us. And the cause
of nearly all this lies embedded in that Frederick; and yet,
so far as I know of it, no critic has yet given an exposition of
such laying there. For our behoof, is there no one that will
take this, that there lies so woven in with much other stuff
so sad to read, to any man that does not believe man was
made to fight alone, to be a butcher of his fellow-man? Who
will do this work, or piece of work, so that all who care may
know how it is that our debt grew so large, and a great deal
more that we ought to know?&mdash;that clearly is one great
reason why the book was written and was printed. Well, I
hope some day all this will be clear to our people, and some
man or men will arise and sweep us clear of these hindrances,
these sad drawbacks to the vitality of our work in this world."<br /><br /></p>

<p class="date"><small>"57, Nile Street, Sunderland, Feb. 7, 1867.</small></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg to acknowledge the receipt of two letters as
additions to your books, which I have read with deep interest,
and shall take care of them, and read them over again, so
that I may thoroughly comprehend them, and be able to think
of them for future use. I myself am not fully satisfied with
our co-operation, and never have been; it is too much tinged
with the very elements that they complain of in our present
systems of trade&mdash;selfishness. I have for years been trying to
direct the attention of the editor of the <i>Co-operator</i> to such
evils that I see in it. Now further, I may state that I find
you and Carlyle seem to agree quite on the idea of the <i>Masterhood</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
qualification. There again I find you both feel and
write as all working men consider just. I can assure you
there is not an honest, noble working man that would not by
far serve under such <i>master</i>-hood, than be the employ&eacute; or
workman of a co-operative store. Working men do not as
a rule make good masters; neither do they treat each other
with that courtesy as a noble master treats his working man.
George Fox shadows forth some such treatment that Friends
ought to make law and guidance for their working men and
slaves, such as you speak of in your letters. I will look the
passage up, as it is quite to the point, so far as I now remember
it. In Vol. VI. of <i>Frederick the Great</i>, I find a great
deal there that I feel quite certain, if our Queen or Government
could make law, thousands of English working men
would hail it with such a shout of joy and gladness as would
astonish the Continental world. These changes suggested by
Carlyle and placed before the thinkers of England, are the
noblest, the truest utterances on real kinghood, that I have
ever read; the more I think over them, the more I feel the
truth, the justness, and also the fitness of them, to our nation's
present dire necessities; yet this is the man, and these are
the thoughts of his, that our critics seem never to see, or if
seen, don't think worth printing or in any way wisely directing
the attention of the public thereto, alas! All this and
much more fills me with such sadness that I am driven almost
to despair. I see from the newspapers, Yorkshire, Lancashire,
and other places are sternly endeavoring to carry
out the short time movement until such times as trade revives,
and I find the masters and men seem to adopt it with a good
grace and friendly spirit. I also beg to inform you I
see a Mr. Morley, a large manufacturer at Nottingham, has
been giving pensions to all his old workmen. I hope such
a noble example will be followed by other wealthy masters.
It would do more to make a master loved, honored, and cared
for, than thousands of pounds expended in other ways. The
Government Savings Banks is one of the wisest acts of late
years done by our Government. I, myself, often wish the

Government held all our banks instead of private men; that
would put an end to false speculations, such as we too often
in the provinces suffer so severely by, so I hail with pleasure
and delight the shadowing forth by you of these noble plans
for the future: I feel glad and uplifted to think of the good
that such teaching will do for us all.</p>

<p>"I now give you the references to <i>Frederick the
Great</i>. Vol. VI.: Land Question, 365 page, where he increases
the number of small farmers to 4,000 (202, 204).
English soldiers and T. C.'s remarks on our system of purchase,
etc. His law, (620, 623, 624). State of Poland
and how he repaired it, (487, 488, 489, 490). I especially
value the way he introduced all kinds of industries therein,
and so soon changed the chaos into order. Again, the school-masters
also are given (not yet in England, says T. C.).
Again the use he made of 15,000<i>l.</i> surplus in Brandenburg;
how it was applied to better his staff of masters. To me,
the Vol. VI. is one of the wisest pieces of modern thought
in our language. I only wish I had either your power, C.
Kingsley, Maurice, or some such able pen-generalship,
to illustrate and show forth all the wise teaching on law,
government, and social life I see in it, and shining like a
star through all its pages.<a name="FNanchor_A_21" id="FNanchor_A_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_21" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>

<p>The letter of the <i>Times'</i> correspondent referred to contained
an account of one of the most singular cases of
depravity ever brought before a criminal court; but it is
unnecessary to bring any of its details under the reader's
attention, for nearly every other number of our journals has
of late contained some instances of atrocities before unthought
of, and, it might have seemed, impossible to humanity.
The connection of these with the modern love of excitement
in the sensational novel and drama may not be generally
understood, but it is direct and constant; all furious
pursuit of pleasure ending in actual desire of horror and
delight in death. I entered into some fuller particulars on
this subject in a lecture given in the spring at the Royal
Institution.</p>

<p>[Any part of the Lecture referred to likely to be of permanent
interest will be printed, somewhere, in this series.]</p>

<h5>Page 76.&mdash;<i>Drunkenness as the Cause of Crime.</i></h5>


<p>The following portions of Mr. Dixon's letter referred to,
will be found interesting:&mdash;<br /><br /></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir,</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your last letter, I think, will arouse the attention of
thinkers more than any of the series, it being on topics they
in general feel more interested in than the others, especially
as in these you do not assail their pockets so much as in the
former ones. Since you seem interested with the notes or
rough sketches on gin, G * * * of Dublin was the man I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
alluded to as making his money by drink, and then giving the
results of such traffic to repair the Cathedral of Dublin. It
was thousands of pounds. I call such charity robbing Peter to
pay Paul! Immense fortunes are made in the <i>Liquor Traffic</i>,
and I will tell you why; it is all paid for in cash, at least such
as the poor people buy; they get credit for clothes, butchers'
meat, groceries, etc., while they give the gin-palace keeper
<i>cash</i>; they never begrudge the price of a glass of gin or beer,
they never haggle over <i>its</i> price, never once think of doing
that; but in the purchase of almost every other article they
haggle and begrudge its price. To give you an idea of its profits&mdash;there
are houses here whose average weekly takings in
cash at their bars is 50<i>l.</i>, 60<i>l.</i>, 70<i>l.</i>,
80<i>l.</i>, 90l<i>.</i>, to 150<i>l.</i>, per
week. Nearly all the men of intelligence in it, say it is
the curse of the working classes. Men whose earnings
are, say 20<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> per week, spend on the average
3<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> per week (some even 10<i>s.</i>). It's my
mode of living to supply these houses with corks that
makes me see so much of the drunkenness; and that is
the cause why I never really cared for <i>my trade</i>, seeing the
misery that was entailed on my fellow men and women by the
use of this stuff. Again, a house with a license to sell spirits,
wine, and ale, to be consumed on the premises, is worth two
to three times more money than any other class of property.
One house here worth nominally 140<i>l.</i> sold the other day for
520<i>l.</i>; another one worth 200<i>l.</i> sold for 800<i>l.</i> I know premises
with a license that were sold for 1,300<i>l.</i>, and then sold
again two years after for 1,800<i>l.</i>; another place was rented
for 50<i>l.</i>, now rents at 100<i>l.</i>&mdash;this last is a house used by
working men and laborers chiefly! No, I honor men like <i>Sir
W. Trevelyan</i>, that are teetotalers, or total abstainers, as an
example to poor men, and, to prevent his work-people being
tempted, will not allow any public-house on his estate. If
our land had a few such men it would help the cause. We
possess one such a man here, a banker. I feel sorry to say
the progress of temperance is not so great as I would like to
see it. The only religious body that approaches to your ideas
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of political economy is Quakerism as taught by George Fox.
Carlyle seems deeply tinged with their teachings. <i>Silence</i>
to them is as valuable to him. Again, why should people
howl and shriek over the law that the Alliance is now trying
to carry out in our land called the Permissive Bill? If we had
just laws we then would not be so miserable or so much annoyed
now and then with cries of Reform and cries of Distress.
I send you two pamphlets;&mdash;one gives the working
man's reasons why he don't go to church; in it you will see
a few opinions expressed very much akin to those you have
written to me. The other gives an account how it is the
poor Indians have died of <i>Famine</i>, simply because they have
destroyed the very system of Political Economy, or one having
some approach to it, that you are now endeavoring to direct
the attention of thinkers to in our country. The <i>Sesame and
Lilies</i> I have read as you requested. I feel now fully the aim
and object you have in view in the Letters, but I cannot
help directing your attention to that portion where you mention
or rather exclaim against the Florentines pulling down
their <i>Ancient Walls</i> to build a <i>Boulevard</i>. That passage is
one that would gladden the hearts of all true <i>Italians</i>,
especially men that love <i>Italy and Dante</i>!"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">A Parisian Character.</span>&mdash;A celebrated character has
disappeared from the Palais Royal. Ren&eacute; Lartique was a
Swiss, and a man of about sixty. He actually spent the last
fifteen years in the Palais Royal&mdash;that is to say, he spent the
third of his life at dinner. Every morning at ten o'clock he
was to be seen going into a restaurant (usually Tissat's),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and in a few moments was installed in a corner, which he
only quitted about three o'clock in the afternoon, after having
drunk at least six or seven bottles of different kinds of wine.
He then walked up and down the garden till the clock struck
five, when he made his appearance again at the same restaurant,
and always at the same place. His second meal, at
which he drank quite as much as at the first, invariably
lasted till half-past nine. Therefore, he devoted nine hours
a day to eating and drinking. His dress was most wretched&mdash;his
shoes broken, his trousers torn, his palet&ocirc;t without any
lining and patched, his waistcoat without buttons, his hat a
rusty red from old age, and the whole surmounted by a dirty
white beard. One day he went up to the <i>comptoir</i>, and
asked the presiding divinity there to allow him to run in
debt for one day's dinner. He perceived some hesitation in
complying with the request, and immediately called one of
the waiters, and desired him to follow him. He went into
the office, unbuttoned a certain indispensable garment, and,
taking off a broad leather belt, somewhat startled the waiter
by displaying two hundred gold pieces, each worth one hundred
francs. Taking up one of them, he tossed it to the
waiter, and desired him to pay whatever he owed. He never
again appeared at that restaurant, and died a few days ago
of indigestion."<br /><br /></p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Revenge in a Ball-Room.</span>&mdash;A distressing event lately
took place at Castellaz, a little commune of the Alpes-Maritimes,
near Mentone. All the young people of the place
being assembled in a dancing-room, one of the young men
was seen to fall suddenly to the ground, whilst a young
woman, his partner, brandished a poniard, and was preparing
to inflict a second blow on him, having already desperately
wounded him in the stomach. The author of the crime was
at once arrested. She declared her name to be Marie P&mdash;&mdash;,
twenty-one years of age, and added that she had acted from
a motive of revenge, the young man having led her astray
formerly with a promise of marriage, which he had never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
fulfilled. In the morning of that day she had summoned
him to keep his word, and, upon his refusal, had determined
on making the dancing-room the scene of her revenge. She
was at first locked up in the prison of Mentone, and afterwards
sent on to Nice. The young man continues in an
alarming state."</p>

<p>I print portions of two letters of Mr. Dixon's in this
place; one referring to our former discussion respecting the
sale of votes:&mdash;<br /><br /></p>

<p class="date"><small>"57, Nile Street, Sunderland, March 21, 1867.</small></p>

<p>"I only wish I could write in some tolerable good style, so that I
could idealize, or rather realize to folks, the life and love, and
marriage of a working man and his wife. It is in my opinion a working
man that really does know what a true wife is, for his every want, his
every comfort in life depends on her; and his children's home, their
daily lives and future lives, are shaped by her. Napoleon wisely said,
'France needs good mothers more than brave men. Good mothers are the
makers or shapers of good and brave men.' I cannot say that these are
the words, but it is the import of his speech on the topic. We have a
saying amongst us: 'The man may spend and money lend, if his wife be
<i>ought</i>,'&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> good wife;&mdash;'but he may work and try to
save, but will have <i>nought</i>, if his wife be nought,'&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>
bad or thriftless wife.</p>

<p>"Now, since you are intending to treat of the working man's parliament
and its duties, I will just throw out a few suggestions of what I
consider should be the questions or measures that demand an early
inquiry into and debate on. That guilds be established in every town,
where masters and men may meet, so as to avoid the temptations of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
public-house and <i>drink</i>. And then, let it be made law that every lad
should serve an apprenticeship of not less than seven years to a trade
or art, before he is allowed to be a member of such guild; also, that
all wages be based on a rate of so much <i>per hour</i>, and not day, as at
present; and let every man prove his workmanship before such a guild,
and then allow to him such payment per hour as his craft merits. Let
there be three grades, and then let there be trials of skill in
workmanship every year; and then, if the workman of the third grade
prove that he has made progress in his craft, reward him accordingly.
Then, before a lad is put to any trade, why not see what he is
naturally fitted for? Combe's book, entitled <i>The Constitution of
Man</i>, throws a good deal of truth on to these matters. Now, here are
two branches of the science of life that, so far, have never once been
given trial of in this way. We certainly use them after a <i>crime</i> has
been committed, but not till then.</p>

<p>"Next to that, cash, payment for all and everything needed in life.
<i>Credit is a curse</i> to him that gives it, and that takes it. He that
lives by credit lives in general carelessly. If there was no credit,
people then would have to live on what they earned! Then, after that,
the Statute of Limitations of Fortune you propose. By the hour system,
not a single man <i>need be idle</i>; it would give employment to all, and
even two hours per day would realize more to a man than <i>breaking
stones</i>. Thus you would make every one self-dependent&mdash;also no
fear of being out of work altogether. Then let there be a Government
fund for all the savings of the working man. I am afraid you will
think this a wild, discursive sort of a letter.</p>

<p><br />"I have read your references to the <i>Times</i> on 'Bribery.'
Well, that has long been my own opinion; they simply have
a vote to sell, and sell it the same way as they sell potatoes,
or a coat, or any other salable article. Voters generally say,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
'What does this gentleman want in Parliament? Why, to
help himself and his family or friends; he does not spend all
the money he spends over his election for pure good of his
country! No: it's to benefit his pocket, to be sure. Why
should I not make a penny with my vote, as well as he does
with his in Parliament?' I think that if the system of canvassing
or election agents were done away with, and all personal
canvassing for votes entirely abolished, it would help
to put down bribery. Let each gentleman send to the electors
his political opinions in a circular, and then let papers
be sent, or cards, to each elector, and then let them go and
record their votes in the same way they do for a councillor
in the Corporation. It would save a great deal of expense,
and prevent those scenes of drunkenness so common in our
towns during elections. <i>Bewick's opinions</i> of these matters
are quite to the purpose, I think (<i>see page 201 of Memoir</i>).
Again, respecting the Paris matter referred to in your last
letter, I have read it. Does it not manifest plainly enough
that Europeans are also in a measure possessed with that
same <i>demoniacal spirit like the Japanese</i>?"</p>

<p>The following letter did not form part of the series written to Mr.
Dixon; but is perhaps worth reprinting. I have not the date of the
number of the <i>Gazette</i> in which it appeared, but it was during the
tailors' strike in London.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="salute">"<span class="smcap">To the Editor of the</span> <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;</p>

<p>"In your yesterday's article on strikes you have very neatly and tersely
expressed the primal fallacy of modern political economy&mdash;to wit, that
'the value of any piece of labor cannot be defined'&mdash;and that 'all
that can be ascertained is simply whether any man can be got to do it for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
certain sum.' Now, sir, the 'value' of any piece of labor, that is to
say, the quantity of food and air which will enable a man to perform
it without losing actually any of his flesh or his nervous energy, is
as absolutely fixed a quantity as the weight of powder necessary to
carry a given ball a given distance. And within limits varying by
exceedingly minor and unimportant circumstances, it is an ascertainable
quantity. I told the public this five years ago&mdash;and under pardon
of your politico-economical contributors&mdash;it is not a
'sentimental,' but a chemical fact.</p>

<p>"Let any half-dozen of recognized London physicians state in precise
terms the quantity and kind of food, and space of lodging, they
consider approximately necessary for the healthy life of a laborer in
any given manufacture, and the number of hours he may, without
shortening his life, work at such business daily, if so sustained.</p>

<p>"And let all masters be bound to give their men a choice between an
order for that quantity of food and lodging, or such wages as the
market may offer for that number of hours' work.</p>

<p>"Proper laws for the maintenance of families would require further
concession&mdash;but, in the outset, let but <i>this</i> law of wages be
established, and if then we have any more strikes you may denounce
them without one word of remonstrance either from sense or
sensibility.</p>
